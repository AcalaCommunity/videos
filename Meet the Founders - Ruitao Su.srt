1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,160
I'm joined here by Ruitao,
CEO and Co-founder of Acala. I'm 

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,320
Dan Reecer and today we're going to be
talking about 

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,840
Ruitao, his kind of background, career,
some personal life and then a little 

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
bit of his thoughts around
Acala and Karura. Ruitao, do you want to 

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
get us started and
maybe introduce yourself? Thanks Dan and 

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,560
hello everyone.
This is Ruitao, one of the Co-founders of 

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,480
Acala network. I'm actually living in New
Zealand. I moved to New Zealand about 

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,240
18+ years ago and pretty much
lived in New Zealand ever since then. 

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,160
I love this place.
Personally, I'm an engineer, I'm a nerd 

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
and also I've been an
entrepreneur for pretty much my whole 

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
life. About seven years ago, I
discovered blockchain and started to 

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
believe that this was/is inevitable. So I got
fully committed on blockchain, about 

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
seven years ago,
and we started our collab 

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
two years ago.
It has been a great ride and 

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
this is what we've been working very
hard for the past two years and this is 

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,000
what we get
at this stage that you will see today. 

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
Awesome. Just so people can get to
know you a little bit better, could you 

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
maybe tell us a few things that you like
to do in your free time, 

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,440
when you're not working, which is most of
the time? 

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,400
I think I have like two addictions.
I would call them addictions. So one 

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
is
snowboarding. I don't actually quite like 

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,840
other sports but snowboarding. It is
something that really gets me going. 

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
Before Covid, I went snowboarding
every year 

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
in the Northern hemisphere and in the
Southern hemisphere. 

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
There's one bonus you get for living in
New Zealand: you get actually two 

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
winter seasons. Usually when it is
summer in the 

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Northern hemisphere, we can ski in the
beautiful mountains in New Zealand, 

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and then, when it's summer in the
New Zealand time, we can go to the 

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
Northern hemisphere to snowboard.
that's one of 

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,440
my biggest addictions or
hobbies, I would say - snowboarding. 

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,280
The other hobby that I have is that,
since I'm a nerd / an engineer, 

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,760
I was really fascinated of creating
my own hobby software or 

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,520
or hardware or a hybrid of those two.
For example in our office on my desk 

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,720
I have
a box made of like primitive 

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,120
electronic parts they actually display
the crypto price. It's a crypto tracker 

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
that I make from for myself
and it is made of Lego. 

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,600
I do have some MCU that's behind it, but
it's actually made of Lego. 

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,720
That's why I call it real money Lego,
as a joke. 

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
Those are my two I would say biggest
addictions: snowboarding and 

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
make electronics. Where do you snowboard
in the Northern hemisphere? 

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,080
In Japan or my favorite
spot is in Colorado. 

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,520
I think there's a number of reasons I
love Colorado. First,  

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,320
people are
so nice 

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,640
in Colorado. Second, because in the
middle of the US continent, 

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,560
the snow quality is guaranteed
to be awesome. 

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
There's no wind, usually there's very
nice weather every day. That's my 

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,160
favorite
ski place. Out of all this ski fields 

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,800
in Colorado, my favorite is
Breckenridge, 

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,160
the reason being is actually a real town,
it has a vibrant 

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,160
community feeling out there. It's not
like a ski resort. 

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
When I go
to Breckenridge, I live 

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,320
off the mountain in a town.
It feels like you're living in 

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,320
in a real village rather than living in
a ski resort. So that's my favorite spot. 

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,720
Good spot. You
talked about skiing or snowboarding 

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
and building kind of like software -
hardware. Is there anything else about 

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
you that
people may not know? 

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,800
I also play some games
competitively. 

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
I used to, I no longer have time
to play them competitively. 

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,720
So I play Counter-Strike, CS go,
I also play 

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
StarCraft 2
back few years ago 

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,640
when it was still
hot. Iplay those two games. 

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,440
I think i answered the question. One
day on Twitter people ask me what 

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
sort of skin I have
when I'm playing CS go. Well,  

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
I have some
nice skin but 

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,760
then I decided to commit in crypto.
I traded all my skins 

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,640
for crypto. That's one of the
best decisions ever. 

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,080
Once you get into crypto, it's
pretty much 24/7. 

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
You don't have time to play anymore. I
mean, I do still play like if I have 

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
five minutes,
I still play a little bit, but I don't 

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,800
play it seriously
anymore. Cool. 

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,160
So one other question.
If you could pick a few characteristics, 

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
how do you think your family or friends
would describe you? 

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
That's actually hard, because I
don't know 

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
what I feel it is going to be accurate, but
I think people will 

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,400
classify me as like a nerd and if people
get to me know better, 

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,920
they will think that I'm quite friendly. 

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm also very very easy to
get along with as well. I make jokes 

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,080
about stuff.
When I play CS go, if I 

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
can find a way to make the whole
team feel happy 

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,120
by doing some silly jokes, and I know that
we are winning for sure, I would do some 

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,640
silly jokes.
Things like that. I think I'm a nerd, 

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,800
but when it comes to actual work, I'm
very serious. I'm serious about what we 

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
are trying to do.
I'm fully convinced that 

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
our belief and our value
proposition is going to be true. 

85
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
That's like two faces of
me: when I am working  

86
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm very
serious, 

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
but very easy going; when I'm playing,
I'm trying to have fun and 

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,040
give me the best
experience for the whole 

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,760
team that's playing with
me. Perfect. 

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,520
This is a question that I asked the
other three Co-founders 

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,880
and it's from this guy Tim Ferriss,
he asked a lot of these people at the 

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,920
interview.
if you had a huge billboard 

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,960
that you could put
in front of a billion people and 

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
give a message
to everyone, what do you think you would 

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
put on that billboard?
On the billboard for everyone? 

96
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
There's so many terms that
I would put, but I think ultimately with the 

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,640
new firm that we are currently managing, I
will put 

98
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,640
"Own your own assets". That's probably the
first that's coming to my mind, because 

99
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
blockchain is actually the very first
technology 

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,280
that enables us to own assets digitally.
Before blockchain, nothing is possible. 

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,200
You think you own your email
account, you don't. 

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
You think you own your facebook
account, you don't. Everything 

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,093
revolving around
this idea of owning your own assets 

104
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:44,160
is very fascinating and
everyone should be 

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,760
able to own their own assets.
It applies to even something that's 

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,200
not in the internet.
If you think about it, you own an asset, 

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,320
for example you own
a car, you have a title in a car, but 

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,920
again it still manages through
an authority. But the blockchain is 

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
the very first technology
that enables to 

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,000
truly own your assets.
I think the very first 

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
idea that I want to preach to the
whole world is that now with blockchain 

112
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
you can own your own assets.
Exactly. 

113
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
On all these weeks where
we've been working 

114
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
a lot and there's a lot on our minds, do
you have 

115
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
any tactics you use for dealing with
maybe 

116
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
stress? Or when you're unfocused,
what do you do in those times to 

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,360
bring yourself back?
Typically I don't get stressed, 

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
because I'm fully convinced that what
we are trying to do 

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
is viable and is inevitable and I want
to be part of that, 

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
but, if I do really get a lot of work and
if I work through 

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
a number of nights, and really
need to have some 

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,480
break free time, then I would go camping.
That's one of the bonus that you 

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,440
get for living in New Zealand, right.
There are so many nice places, 

124
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,600
quiet places. Within
one / two hour drive, you can 

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,720
put your tent in the back of your car
and then you can just go camp 

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,200
for a night. In the
morning you will wake up with 

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,560
birds
singing,  

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,200
you will see a lot of nice quiet
scenery. 

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,640
One of the best things of
camping is that 

130
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,360
I will bring some snack with me, I can
watch a movie in the tent, I can have 

131
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
some snacks and that's like a break free
time for me. 

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I would say that, if I really get
stressed, I will go camping. I would still 

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
bring my laptop with me, though, in
case I need to respond to messages 

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,840
in an urgent way I can still do it.
That's probably the best way for me 

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,200
to get some break free time out of
the 

136
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,760
almost 24/7 working cycle.
You're kind of an 

137
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,560
advertisement for visiting and living in
New Zealand right now. 

138
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,680
I think during Covid
it's a very good place to live in 

139
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
because
there's pretty much no Covid her, 

140
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,520
but I think, after the world will open up
when Covid will be 

141
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,280
eradicated, everyone
should visit 

142
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,720
New Zealand. It's one of the most
beautiful country in the world. 

143
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,280
People are friendly.
The scenery is nice. I just like 

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,760
every part of it.
It's the place where I live. 

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
We need to get a crypto conference
together there someday. 

146
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,840
There's a rich community here.
Maybe we should, right. So, once 

147
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
we finish all the very
aggressive 

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,320
pace work that we're currently working 

149
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
on, maybe we should start to build the community.
Well, actually it's already in progress. 

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,840
We already have a Polkadot and
Kusama meetup here 

151
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,280
in New Zealand. We haven't posted
any events yet, but we will. 

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
Let's move onto a little bit
about your career. 

153
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Could you walk us through your
career path and what led you to the 

154
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,960
blockchain world and
ultimately starting Acala? 

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,320
I would say that I have
this entrepreneurial mind 

156
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
built into my brain.
After graduating from the university, I 

157
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
only had one job, which
was a financial-related job. 

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm still in very good relation with
my very first boss. 

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,360
After that, I've been pretty
much on my own. 

160
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
For the past 18 plus years, I've been
an 

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,040
entrepreneur and I work for myself.
Before I got into the crypto, I was an 

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,880
independent app developer. Because
I'm an engineer myself, 

163
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm also pretty good at
(maybe with a bit of sarcasm) 

164
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
designing stuff. I'm a
fullstack 

165
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,560
app developer. I created a number of apps.
It has been a 

166
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
very good experience
working 

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
with the app store, with working with
Apple. Pretty much all the apps that I did 

168
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
were featured
by Apple. I created one app for 

169
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
myself as a hobby. I created a
ski tracker 

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
that would tell you like what time it is, 

171
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
what your current speed is
and that at the end of your day 

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,960
would tell you how
how much ride 

173
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
you did for that day and would give you a
whole 

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,200
map of where you've been to in the
mountain. That 

175
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,640
was probably one of the last
apps I created. It 

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,040
was again featured by Apple. I loved the
idea of working on something that can bring 

177
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
meaningful value for users and for
other people. 

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,240
I was very surprised to
find that, I when I was 

179
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,280
riding in Breckenridge back
I don't know how many years ago, 

180
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,960
there's another rider that's sitting
in a shared lift 

181
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,280
beside me and he's using the app that I
developed and that's like what makes me 

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,080
really really happy about that.
Since I was developing the app in 

183
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,100
New Zealand, I had to test it.
It was summer in New Zealand and 

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,280
there was no mountain to test.
So I drive the car upside down 

185
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,840
in a tiny park to test if
that worked. So that's it, before 

186
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,200
blockchain I was pretty much
into all the areas that have 

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,360
potentials on new
sectors. I discovered a bit 

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
about Bitcoin when it was less than a
hundred dollars. I don't know when was 

189
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,280
that.
By then I wasn't convinced. I thought 

190
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
it was impossible.
I knew the idea but I didn't 

191
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
think it would
become something  

192
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
that's actually viable.
But after Bitcoin rose to 

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,480
a 1000 dollar / 2000
dollar, 

194
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,760
at that point I was convinced.
The impossible happened. 

195
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
What will come after
that would be the inevitable. 

196
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
That's when I decided I needed
to get onto this sector, 

197
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
get into this blockchain movement.
So, I joined a venture in New Zealand. It's a 

198
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,600
blockchain startup. This
startup was grow rapidly 

199
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,000
during the
2017 ICO boom. 

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,160
In that period, I learned a lot.
From that experience, 

201
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
there's a number of things that
I still 

202
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,513
consider valuable lessons today.
One thing is 

203
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:04,400
how to stay motivated when
there are so many things happening; how to 

204
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,200
stay motivated and create something
that's actually 

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,240
viable and can bring value for all the
token holders, all the users, 

206
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,520
everyone evolved in the ecosystem of the
product that you are creating. 

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,240
That's something I learned. The other
thing that I also learned is that how 

208
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
to scale and stay focused.
Because like we are in the 

209
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
exponential growth
era in this industry, 

210
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
you can see that companies grow very very
fast, but 

211
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
growing a company while stay focused,
stay tuned 

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,200
to your value proposition is
quite challenging. 

213
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
it's about team building, it's about
bringing together people with the same mindset. 

214
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,960
It's the hardest thing to do.
That's the lesson I learned 

215
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,480
and I'm very very fortunate to have met
Bryan 

216
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
and Bette. They are all Co-founders of
Acala. I worked with them 

217
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,080
in the previous
project and I know them because I 

218
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,520
worked directly with them for over
a year. I would say that 

219
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,400
we share the same value proposition, we
share the same 

220
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,960
personality and we think we are
a perfect match 

221
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,480
for building a team together. At
some point I started thinking: 

222
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
if I want to create
something 

223
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,360
that's actually useful and that
has an 

224
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,280
impact in this industry, then I need to
start my own venture. That's when 

225
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I had the idea of creating this new venture.
I had Ruitao, I had Bette as Co-founders. 

226
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,240
I wanted to work in this sector.
That's when 

227
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,560
I started to work on this. About two
years or two and a half years ago, 

228
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
we started this new venture
with Bette and Bryan. 

229
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
We got fully committed to this new venture.
We talked about the idea of 

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
what we could or
should work on. I think the core 

231
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
value of this team is that we believe
that, regardless where we 

232
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,040
work on, it needs to be viable, it needs
to have a market 

233
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
product fit. That's where we see
the finance sector is going to be the 

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,640
very first sector to have this product
market fit. 

235
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,600
About two and a half years ago
we started this new venture and I'm very 

236
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
fortunate.
At that time,  

237
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,520
I went to the very first
hackathon that 

238
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,920
took place in China, in Hangzhou. This was
a Polkadot hackathon. 

239
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,000
That's where I met the
other Co-founder Fuyao in China. 

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,520
That's how Acala was
conceived. Pretty much after 

241
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,920
that, we've been working
every day 

242
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
24/7, working on the product,
getting the product out, 

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,120
getting all the code ready.
Everything went and is going very well. 

244
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
I see this is only
the beginning, right. 

245
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
We have the code
pretty much ready to go, but we 

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,400
haven't launched the network yet.
I think that, once we launch 

247
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
the network, it is still the very
beginning of what would be possible 

248
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,680
in the upcoming two or
three years. 

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
There was a period in there where
you guys, 

250
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,840
the three of you, started Laminar. Is that
right? Yes. 

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Can you talk about starting
Laminar and then how that evolved into 

252
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,360
Acala and maybe the process you guys
went through? 

253
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,760
You didn't just pick Polkadot
you evaluated several different options. 

254
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,680
I think maybe talking about that and how
you chose Polkadot would be interesting 

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,320
too.
I think back then we already 

256
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,640
connected with Parity, so we already knew
Substrate. 

257
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,360
But when we started this new venture,
Laminar, 

258
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,560
we were thinking about what we should do,
what we should work on, 

259
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,080
and, as I mentioned previously, we thought that,
whatever we would work on, we needed to work 

260
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,680
on something that's viable and has a
market product fit. 

261
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,080
Finance is the first sector that we
could see 

262
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,560
it could bring real useful applications on top
of blockchain. No matter what we do, 

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,840
our belief is that we need to
work on something finance-related. 

264
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,160
We thought about all the stuff that we
could do. We had the idea of 

265
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,200
bringing a synthetic asset training
protocol that can allow 

266
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,080
trader to trade in a leveraged way -
which is 

267
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,920
under development still today. 

268
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
We thought that
we needed to work on something that's like 

269
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,520
financial base layer or primitive or
something like that. 

270
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
We started evaluating that: where do
we wanted to deploy 

271
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,520
our solution onto? Back then Ethereum
wasn't that congested 

272
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,840
but we researched every
single 

273
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
viable base layer out there. We did some
research on Ethereum 2. 

274
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
We did research on Cosmos and, although
we already knew Parity, we also 

275
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
did an independent assessment about
Substrate and Polkadot. 

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,040
We think Ethereum 2 is super cool,
but we do not know when it's gonna 

277
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,840
become available. 

278
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
We think Cosmos is also a very good
framework. It allows 

279
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,240
builders to build a blockchain
in a very fast way. But again we bounced 

280
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
into a problem: if we want to
build something that's 

281
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,880
bankrate security, how do we boost our
security? 

282
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,400
Ultimately we reached the conclusion
that, if you look at Substrate, 

283
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
it is the best
among all 

284
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
other base layers. It offers the
flexibility 

285
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,520
for developers like us to create
blockchain with 

286
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,080
full customizability. It offers
the security needed to deploy a 

287
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,840
blockchain
onto Kusama or onto Polkadot network. 

288
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
It also enables the
interoperability that 

289
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
will create no
longer a liquidity sylo. 

290
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
Then we will be working
using Substrate and we're going to 

291
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
work on Polkadot.
That's pretty much an educated decision. 

292
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,120
it's less than a guess, it's
actually more of an informed 

293
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,680
educated decision. When we're looking
back two years ago, the Polkadot 

294
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,240
ecosystem was very different from what we
know today. 

295
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,680
There were few teams that were building
on Polkadot, 

296
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,280
only a handful teams
were building. We pretty much 

297
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
knew all the other teams that were building
in the Polkadot ecosystem. 

298
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
We saw a lot of stuff that's lacking,
for example there's no stablecoin. 

299
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
Substrate wasn't very mature
back then, I mean even the 

300
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,720
idea project wasn't
in 

301
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
the reach of light launch.
We thought there were so many 

302
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,560
things lacking at that time. If we wanted
to work on something that's finance 

303
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,280
related, we're gonna
work on those financial primitives. 

304
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,880
That's when we met Fuyao.
Fuyao had the same idea, 

305
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,720
we shared the same idea.
That's essentially how Acala network 

306
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,680
was born: a set of financial primitives
to make sure that 

307
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,080
the whole financial sector, the whole
financial 

308
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,240
application can be enabled on top of
Polkadot. 

309
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,760
That's awesome. I just learned some
things myself, so appreciate that. 

310
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's move on to
Acala and Karura. 

311
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
One thing I was just wondering,
if you were to describe 

312
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,840
Karura. So for people's
background who may not be aware, so we're 

313
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,800
building
Acala as this DeFi hub for Polkadot and 

314
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,680
then Karura is our DeFi hub we're
building for Kusama. 

315
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Could you just describe
if you were to pick three 

316
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,280
characteristics, how would you
describe Karura in 

317
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,120
three words? This is an
interesting question. In three 

318
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,920
words.
I would say "wild", that's really the 

319
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,800
very first word that I can think of,
that's the nature of Kusama. 

320
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,120
The second one I would say "vibrant",
because that's 

321
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,800
my feeling for the Kusama community. It's
even more distributed. 

322
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Finally, I wouldn't use
the word "chaos", but I would like to use 

323
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
something ...
let me think  

324
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,040
about what world ...
"aggressive", probably is the word. 

325
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,840
We would like to roll out
new and brave ideas on Karura. It's the 

326
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,640
canary network. It's also
to serve this model of more 

327
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
fast-paced, more aggressive communities.
Those are probably the 

328
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,360
three words that I can think of as my
initial shots. 

329
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,360
Just for people's background,
what are some examples of things that we 

330
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,840
could do differently on Karura than
Acala. I know there's like collaterals. 

331
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,880
Could you explain more about that?
I think that's like the 

332
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
collaterals which
might be slightly relaxed, 

333
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,600
but we still want to make sure
the whole system is secure. 

334
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
There's a lot of stuff. For example, I
play game, right. I think 

335
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,960
gamification plus finance could be a
very very 

336
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
vital idea, a very very fun idea to explore.
Maybe we can start to 

337
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
play with some gamification on
finance on Karura. 

338
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,800
Nothing is promised, but
I'm thinking about stuff that coming 

339
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,040
out of my head right now.
Maybe there might be a lottery 

340
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,360
somewhere. If you mint stablecoin, maybe
you get 

341
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
an extra interest or something like that.
This is the stuff that we can 

342
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,680
definitely explore
on the more vibrant and wilder community. 

343
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,800
And also evaluating
what sort of character we want to 

344
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,480
accept
for a bankrupt security product like 

345
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,440
Acala. You're gonna be very very
solid. You have to prove liquidity, 

346
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,960
you have to be very very conservative
because you don't want it to fail. 

347
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
So for example, if the liquidity is not quite
there yet, but we can explore 

348
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
a number of
characters or things like that 

349
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,320
in the Karura network, as long as like if
it doesn't go wrong. 

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
Well, maybe it's another good idea to
explore as well. You can think about a 

351
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
lot of like
newly opened and very very 

352
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
hot coins or tokens being accepted as
collateral. 

353
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Maybe. These are some of the general
thoughts I have. 

354
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,640
Awesome. On a similar question,
let's switch to Acala now. 

355
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,680
How would you describe Acala in three
words? 

356
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,680
Well in three words again, let me think
about that. 

357
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,320
I think the very
first one should be "secure" 

358
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,160
or "safe" or something like that. So the
very first way should give 

359
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,960
a sense of security. I think that's
the most important thing if you want to 

360
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,280
become the financial Layer.
It has to be secure. The second would be 

361
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,760
focused on
something that's about 

362
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
a word we
can use for 

363
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,800
"owning your own bank", like as a sense of
ownership. Right. So maybe a "sense of 

364
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,600
ownership", that's it.
It's something secure, it's something 

365
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
solid, but also you can have a part of
that. 

366
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,840
If Acala would be your own bank,
you can actually own 

367
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,760
a fraction of that by ourselves.
Secure. 

368
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,400
Ownership.
The final word that I would 

369
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,160
say
is probably like "long-term". 

370
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,040
Because we're here and it would align
with 

371
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,160
our value proposition. We think the DeFi
movement is on a very early stage 

372
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,000
and essentially I believe that the DeFi is
going to 

373
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
cover pretty much the whole world's
population, that will be translating on top of 

374
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
blockchain.
Regardless of the trend that was 

375
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,360
defined directly or that's
strengthening with some sort 

376
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,600
of financial service, they're
actually using 

377
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440
blockchain as a backend. But,
ultimately, the whole financial sector 

378
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,560
will be generating on top of blockchain.
If you want to 

379
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,360
build something that's part of
this revolution, we would like to 

380
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,960
have Acala as one of the
projects 

381
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,840
that will exist not only within the the hype
cycle but also have a long-term plan 

382
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
of seven to
ten years. 

383
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,240
I want to be take part of this history.
The last word I would use is 

384
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,560
"long-term" or "committed".
Cool. So, we've gone over 

385
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
both of our networks. We're
running these in parallel and they'll 

386
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,160
continue to be run in parallel and,
just for people's background, Polkadot 

387
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,960
and Kusama will be bridged,
so there will be assets flowing between 

388
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,720
Polkadot and Kusama, and then of course
Acala and Karura on top of those networks. 

389
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's move on to kind of more
internal stuff. 

390
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
As I just mentioned, we're building
these two networks. 

391
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,520
We have a rapidly growing team of what I
would consider a lot of just 

392
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
A players. Everyone's hard worker, smart, 

393
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,040
we all work really well together, been on
fire recently. 

394
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,440
How do you look at our culture?
How would you describe our culture 

395
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,120
internally?
On a similar note, how do you evaluate 

396
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,040
new hires? What kind of characteristics
do you look for in 

397
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,280
potential new hires? I think
pretty much in the whole team we 

398
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,000
have a number of
unique 

399
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,480
characteristics. So, one characteristic is
there we are very very engineering 

400
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,480
driven. That's very
essential for 

401
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,520
pretty much all the blockchain staff
- that you have an 

402
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,360
engineer-driven culture. Because
it is on a very early stage of movement, 

403
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
you need to get your hand dirty, you need
to understand 

404
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,080
how every single bit of piece works,
essentially for the whole team. 

405
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
I think Dan understands pretty much how
the product works inside out 

406
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
and pretty much everyone that's in the
team understands how the product 

407
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
works inside out.
It's a very engineer focus or 

408
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,000
engineer-driven culture.
With blockchain you can code a 

409
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,800
bank and that's essentially what we're
doing: a set of engineers 

410
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,480
code a bank out of nowhere. That's the
very first 

411
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,280
characteristic. The next characteristic is that
we are a very distributed team and 

412
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,520
that's the nature of any
blockchain staff as well. 

413
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm in New Zealand, San is in
Brazil or 

414
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,240
in the US, depending on the time of the year.
We have 

415
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Robin, we have our contributor in the
United States, we have contributor in 

416
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
Shanghai, in Albania,
in New York and will be 

417
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,400
growing
in the same way: acquiring new 

418
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,480
talents in a distributed way.
There's a number of reasons for 

419
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
that. One of the reason is that the
blockchain market is still a very niche 

420
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,360
market
to acquire the best talents. They are 

421
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,640
pretty much
not around, they are not like in the 

422
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,720
neighborhood, you can't find them in the
local market! 

423
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,160
If you want to find the
best teammates, it's pretty much 

424
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,200
unlikely to be your neighbor. So we have
a 

425
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,680
distributed team.
We also have this sense of 

426
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,720
ownership
and accountability. For a distributed 

427
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
team to move and
to 

428
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,080
work in a very productive way, it
is very essential that every one of us 

429
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,480
has a sense of accountability,
has a sense of ownership. That is, 

430
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,875
realising that what you are working on
has an effect and dependence on you 

431
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,240
peer and team members.
As long 

432
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,840
as we communicate clearly,
as long as we deliver and a have sense of 

433
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,800
we are building this
product together, we can move in a much 

434
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,040
much
smoother and productive way. I think, 

435
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,080
ultimately,
the final characteristic, that we have in 

436
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,600
the current team, is that
it's essentially and literally flat. 

437
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,720
In everyday work,
everyone 

438
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,240
understands how their part
is contributing into creating these 

439
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,560
products and everyone takes that role.
There's 

440
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,480
the culture that you can
talk to everyone directly, talking about 

441
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,320
how we can make this product better, how
we can 

442
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,400
make this product viable, how we
can launch the product properly. 

443
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
That's essentially
the way we communicate, 

444
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,680
that's the way we work with every
team members. We're lucky that pretty 

445
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,760
much all the team members that we bring
on today 

446
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,400
are very very accountable, very very
responsible and already very good at 

447
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,440
what they are doing.
We like to keep it that way, right. 

448
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,480
Thats's the lesson
I mentioned that I had learned: 

449
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,560
you want to scale but you also want to
scale 

450
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,400
in an effective way. You don't want to
bring 

451
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,360
players that might drag down the team
morale 

452
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,880
or push down the productivity, because, by
then, it will be 

453
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
very very hard to correct. Every new
team member that we want to bring on 

454
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
needs
to share the same value 

455
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,480
as what we believe such as the true 

456
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,440
nature of decentralization, the
opportunity that we are enabling, 

457
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,360
the opportunities that
we can bring 

458
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,880
to all the people that are not yet
using blockchain. Second, 

459
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
the new team member also need to have
this same 

460
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,840
values of
accountability, responsibility, as part 

461
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,600
of the the protocol and of the
product that you will work on, 

462
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,800
that you treat it as your own baby and
deliver it. 

463
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,160
With blockchain
it is pretty much walking around the clock. 

464
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,360
Maybe one sentence can describe that:
"work hard and play hard", when 

465
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
it's needed. Maybe you will work hard for a
number of weeks, like 

466
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,440
we're facing right now as we think
we're going to launch the Karura 

467
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
network pretty soon, so everyone is in
battle station mode. But, when you are not 

468
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,640
that busy, then maybe
learn something, new explore 

469
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,080
protocol or something like that. I
think that's pretty much the culture 

470
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
of the current team members 

471
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,400
that's working on the Acala or on
the other products. 

472
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,200
Perfect. You kind of touched on
this a little bit, but, 

473
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
in these times when we're working so
much and 

474
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,920
we've got all everything going on, what
would you say 

475
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,000
gets you out of bed in the
morning? What it 

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,520
inspires you to do what you do every day
and keeps you motivated? 

477
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,560
About what really keeps me
motivated right now, 

478
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't know who said
that 

479
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,280
but I read the Twitter
some time ago saying: 

480
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,840
"hey,
the crypto market is doing great that's 

481
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,880
all right but,
the question is that, if 

482
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,760
everyone's better off with the crypto
going up, 

483
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,880
then who is going to build the crypto?
Who is going to build the products? Who's 

484
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
continuing to
stay motivated 

485
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,320
and deliver products to make this
crypto 

486
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
a reality for
our future?" 

487
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,760
I think what keeps me motivated 

488
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
it's not
about 

489
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,600
hey Bitcoin is going up few thousand
dollars or something like that. It's more 

490
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,080
like every
day every morning I wake up and I think 

491
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,200
about how to be able to create
a product / a protocol that I have a part in 

492
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,720
making but it's not totally owned by me.
It's owned by thousands of people. 

493
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,120
It has like millions of users.
Their life 

494
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,360
is better because I
created this product. 

495
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,040
They're able to exchange faster, they're
able to have higher interest rate in 

496
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,360
their bank account.
The millions of users, 

497
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
or token holders or traders or
whatever committee members, 

498
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,440
they are better off because of what I
am creating and I am part of this 

499
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,840
movement. That's what made me
stay motivated. 

500
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
In our office, we
have a 

501
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,640
screen, showing all the latest metrics of
the product that we're building - 

502
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
because we haven't gone live yet.
The metrics that are being shown are 

503
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,040
basically how the testnet
is getting hit, 

504
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,480
what's the server load, what's
our community 

505
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,400
size, which is growing every day.
Those numbers actually make me 

506
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,280
stay motivated. I would like to see that,
once we go live, 

507
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,440
the number of um transactions they're
able to facilitate, 

508
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
the number of users, the number of
financial application, 

509
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,400
traders that we are able to serve,
grow and that's what keeps me going every 

510
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,320
day.
Great. Let's wrap up with one 

511
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,880
more question.
If you were to think forward in 

512
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,400
terms of how you're mentally preparing
for the next, maybe three to five years, 

513
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,720
in terms of where you see
our product going but also DeFi and 

514
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,600
blockchain,
how would you describe that future 

515
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
of
what DeFi might look like? 

516
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,840
I think the DeFi movement or
actually I would call it the 

517
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,400
the whole financial sector
on blockchain movement, it's very very 

518
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,240
early at this stage. If you
compare the existing DeFi market 

519
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,920
to the conventional financial
market, 

520
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,480
it's peanuts. Well ultimately I do
believe that 

521
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,040
the current blockchain is going to
be the backbone of 

522
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,720
everything finance-related in the future.
We don't know how it's going to happen. 

523
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
We don't know when,
how long it will take 

524
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
for us to get to that stage.
I also believe that 

525
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,120
during this movement it's not going to
be like a 100% percent that everyone 

526
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,640
will be making transaction directly
on the blockchain. It is also not 100% 

527
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,840
that the blockchain is just used as
a server, being set up by a 

528
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,040
few financial institutions as well.
I believe in a 

529
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,160
in a mix, in a fusion of both.
Someone like me or some engineer, some 

530
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,320
new younger generations, they might
prefer to transact directly 

531
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,720
with the blockchain and that's possible,
that's viable. 

532
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,160
And someone like my mom or
someone that's not that nerdy, 

533
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,320
they might want to to choose to get the
benefit of DeFi 

534
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,600
or get a benefit for blockchain, but they
will translate through some sort of 

535
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,080
crypto finance service provider
or new generation type of bank. I 

536
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,960
think this is a movement that will take
take at least 

537
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,000
five years, ten years
to move. But again, this is purely a 

538
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
software movement, so
it might happen sooner than we expected. 

539
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,680
We just need to make sure that we are
prepared for that. 

540
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
Lastly, I would just say that
this is something that's 

541
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,520
very very early but the potential that
we are able to achieve, 

542
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,440
the potential we're able to bring for
the whole population is limitless. 

543
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,560
Think about all the unbanked people in
the world, they are 

544
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,400
possibly switch to being able, by using DeFi, to 

545
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,800
finally access
financial instruments. For 

546
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
people that already have access to the
conventional finance sector, 

547
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
they might be better off with using
transact 

548
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
with blockchain directly, they might have
interest rates, they might have better 

549
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
freedom
in what they are doing. 

550
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,080
I'm fully committed to this sector
and I will say that maybe 

551
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,560
we will be laser focused for the next
six months/ next one year on Acala, 

552
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,880
an that is the short term for the
improvement of product and the movement, but in 

553
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,760
long-term, we'll all be thinking that we
will be keep improving, 

554
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
we'll be keep innovating and that's how
we stay relevant in this industry 

555
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,640
until at least half of the world
population is connecting to blockchain. 

556
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
And that will probably take five years,
10 years, but we are committed to do that! 

557
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,840
Great. Well I think that's about it. I
learned a lot and appreciate the time. 

558
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,560
Let's get back to work.
Well, yeah, let's get back to launch 

559
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,800
Karura.
yeah thanks thank you then.
