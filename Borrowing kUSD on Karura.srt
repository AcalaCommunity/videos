[Music]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,280
and this is one the reason that i we

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
think why crew is so useful

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,759
when it's become a project you can

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,799
unlock the utility of your kusama token

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
and start to

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,240
um to to to borrow against your your uh

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,400
your

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
summer token so this is the borough

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
borrowing interface

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,039
uh you can see an overview of your

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,439
current position so you can see

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
you have um i have already borrowed open

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
a position on ram bdc

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
i borrow roughly um three thousand

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,120
dollars against

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
zero point one run bdc that's a little

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,160
bit risky but i mean that's what um the

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
system allows

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
um you can actually create loans using

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
any sort of asset that will be

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
available um in the governance process

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
allowed to be using crypto

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,640
and in this particular interface here i

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
have dot

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
l dot which we'll be covering later and

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
this will be definitely it would be like

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
kusama

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
el kikuzama and bitcoins so what i'm

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
going to

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
demo here is that i'm going to borrow

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
more uh

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,600
against my 0.1 ram btc position here

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
so you can see um the current bitcoin

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,920
oracle rate is

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,760
roughly that number i'm still quite safe

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
to borrow a little bit more against that

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,119
0.1 ram bdc

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
so i'm going to press generate more i'm

40
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,920
going to press hey i would like to

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,400
probably ten dollars more

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,080
and i press confirm and this is where

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
the signing comes up i'm gonna type in

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,560
my key

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,640
password and sign the transaction and

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
boom i have ten dollar more that i can

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
spend and this is how fast um

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
and production network looks like and

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
all this is happening on the fly for

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,880
real

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
um and you can actually see this on the

52
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
on the on the block scanner that's

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
provided by sub scan

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
so um this is amazing right this is um

55
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
much much

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
more um responsive much much more user

57
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,799
friendly

58
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,439
also i can also replay right i can pay

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
back i set a position if i think um

60
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,439
i'm going to reduce a little bit of risk

61
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,680
here i can pay about 100 year ausd

62
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,479
that's like reducing my calculation

63
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
ratio

64
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,240
and any asset that will be available

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
through the governance process can be

66
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
borrowed against

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
different assets would have different

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,319
risk parameters so for example bitcoin

69
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,920
might have a risk parameter

70
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
on the medieval credit ratio on the

71
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,760
liquidation ratio on the liquidation fee

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,720
uh dots l dots ksm lksm they might all

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
have different

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,160
ratio they'll be managed and governed by

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
the governance process

76
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
so that is uh essentially how you borrow

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
against um

78
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,840
kratchos uh in guru

79
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,040
yeah let so maybe one thing we can do

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
this concept

81
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,120
of collateralization and taking loans is

82
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,640
probably new to a lot of people i know

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
it was new to me

84
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
um at one point and basically like to to

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
make this as simple as possible

86
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,920
um like i think many of us are aware of

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
how like a home

88
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
loan works where typically you might put

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,480
like 10 down or 20

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
down that cash that you put down is what

91
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
you're putting

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,879
down in order to get the full the full

93
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
loan of whatever you're getting for that

94
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,959
house

95
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,840
but with the way this works in crypto um

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
we're actually over you're over

97
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
collateralizing

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
the loan so that's why these collateral

99
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,480
ratios are over

100
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
100 and you're what you're doing like

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
what it really means of collateral

102
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
is that you're actually taking bitcoin

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,400
something like bitcoin

104
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,920
you don't need to sell it but you can

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
pull out

106
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,959
ausd a stablecoin with your bitcoin

107
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,599
still there

108
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,400
not sold and then you can take the ausd

109
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
and either

110
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
you can send that to people you can make

111
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,480
payments you can use that to provide

112
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
liquidity within our decks but

113
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
that's essentially what this collateral

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
ratio means

115
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
yeah essentially give you more utility

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,959
um to the asset that you are holding to

117
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,760
that you might not want to sell or in

118
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
short term

119
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,080
and for example for fukusama for for

120
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,920
lksm those are perfectly great collector

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
for you to gain more utility

122
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
out of your 16 kusama holdings you can

123
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,319
go long you can go short you can

124
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
it's i mean the option is it's in your

125
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,239
hand to decide how you're going to use

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
this collector um to trade and write

127
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
with the market

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,879
what about interest so are you paying

129
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,920
interest when you're taking out

130
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,760
these loans and how does that work yes

131
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,599
so the interest essentially is what we

132
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
call the stabilization fee

133
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
um if you take a long there will be

134
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
definitely some interest occur

135
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
um and this is also the interest used to

136
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
manage the

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
supply and demand of the stablecar as

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
well as like the

139
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
um the way to maintain that the

140
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
stablecoin will be packed to to

141
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
a dollar in value and the interest um

142
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,360
all the state

143
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
stabilization fee will be managed by the

144
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
governance process

145
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,400
really depends on demands and supplies

146
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,720
and do you know your interest rate

147
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
before you take out the loan

148
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
obviously definitely so let's say that

149
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
we want to create a lot we're going to

150
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,919
create some ldl ksm and spectro

151
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,360
i'm going to put in maybe 5l uh l ksm

152
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
here and i'm going to take maybe a two

153
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
dollar loan

154
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,280
you can already see that um um

155
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,400
the amount of money that you can borrow

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
the interest rate in here the

157
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
liquidation penalty

158
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
yeah if things goes wrong that where how

159
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
you can but in chance that if you over

160
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,560
capitalize and the position becomes

161
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
risky

162
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
you might get liquidated so this is the

163
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
um the

164
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
the the figure that you're able to see

165
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
before you

166
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
create a lawn and the final confirmation

167
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
stage you will be

168
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
once again so go ahead and confirm all

169
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
the numbers

170
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
and press confirm and this is how you

171
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,639
open a long position so

172
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
i just created a loan using my lksm and

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
received like two

174
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
dollars so you can say if i now go back

175
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
to the interface

176
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,320
i have two position open one with

177
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
bitcoin one with um

178
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
lksm those is like um and i totally have

179
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
borrowed

180
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,600
probably like few thousand dollars

181
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
against both um lksm

182
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
and ram btc okay that makes sense

183
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
and someone asked where does that

184
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,560
interest actually go

185
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
well the n26 actually go to the treasury

186
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
um

187
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
and being managed by the network right

188
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
it's uh it's essentially

189
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,720
uh controlled by the network for the

190
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
long prosperity of the network

191
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
the interest ultimately would be the

192
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
surplus within this system

193
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
and if you read our white paper

194
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,319
regarding the decentralized solving

195
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,360
wheels fund

196
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,840
the interest is ultimately hold managed

197
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,199
by the token holders

198
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
okay the liquidation concept i think is

199
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
new to a lot of people

200
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,120
what happens if the token that is

201
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,560
basically collateralized

202
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,319
the value drops so liquidation in this

203
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
sense does not mean that you kind of

204
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
like lose everything that you put down

205
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,479
that's why there was a liquidation

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,919
percentage so in the example rotate just

207
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
showed it said 20

208
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,440
yeah i think to better um think about

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
liquidation it's more of like

210
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
uh if you collect allies and you borrow

211
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
against your bitcoin and then pick a job

212
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
to a particular price

213
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
a fraction of your collector will be

214
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
sold and you will see that if you were

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
just like sold those collectors

216
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
at that price you would still hold on to

217
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
the the money they borrow against it's

218
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,840
just like

219
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:03,840
you sold those characters at a penalty

220
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,479
you
