1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,560
大家好, 我是Dan Reecer

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,639
来自Acala的增长副总裁

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
我已经在Acala团队中好几个月了

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,320
而之前花时间在

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
Web3 基金会上

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,080
我曾在那里帮助发起Polkadot以及

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Kusama。今天，我可能会

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,119
说得很快

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
希望能够把这视频

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
维持在5到7分钟内

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
我要谈论的是

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
Polkadot和Kusama 的平行链竞拍

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
以及众贷相关的过程

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
及如何在其中一个链上启动

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
一个区块链

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
你可能知道的 Polkadot 和 Kusama 是

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
一个多链生态系统

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
连接在一起

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
而这一些区块链被称为

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
平行链

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
将来我们会有至少

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
上百个平行链在Polkadot以及

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,480
上百个

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,480
上百个平行链在Kusama，但到目前为止还没有

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
任何一个平行链在Polkadot或Kusama。

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
所以今天我要谈谈如何

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
实际获得一个平行链插槽

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,199
作为图表里的小方块之一

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
您如何能够成为

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
第一个

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,320
在Kusama的平行链，或者

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
在Polkadot的平行链

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
以及众贷(Crowdloan)的进程

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
还有平行链插槽竞拍。所以

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
这是时间线。您可以在这里查看

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
那个众贷会先启动

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
然后接下来，我们会进入主要

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
的环节，那就是平行链插槽竞拍

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
就在白色这里

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
这将会是多个平行链团队

41
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
基本上是相互竞拍的

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
试图赢得这次的竞拍。

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,119
竞拍胜者将会前进

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,240
并获取一个插槽

45
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
在绿色中。一旦您获取一个插槽

46
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,000
您已经正式开启

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
Kusama 或 Polkadot 上的平行链

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
而您的团队可以开始

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
启动您的应用程序

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
并在其上面创建应用程序等等。

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
这最终将会是

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,240
Polkadot和Kusama的愿景。

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,399
然后您可以在这最后的部分看到

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
此插槽的实际结束时间

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,560
该团队

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
获取的插槽

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
然后接下来会发生的一些事情

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
包括众贷资金的

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
返回

60
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
给贡献者等等

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,439
接下来我将会谈到所有这些

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
幻灯片。

63
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,439
所以我将从平行链插槽竟拍开始

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
因为您需要了解这个

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,159
而接着才进入众贷的课题。所以

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
一个平行链插槽竟拍本质上是

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,959
像我所说过的

68
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,720
以团队竞拍模式来尝试

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,720
赢得其中一个插槽

70
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,440
每次竟拍最终都在进行

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
一个槽, 而且可以分成较小的槽位

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
但最终

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
在 Polkadot 上，它最多只可以长达 24 个月

74
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
但有些团队可能决定竟选

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,080
较短暂的时间，但就以这个简单的情况

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
只是假定了最长的时段。

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
那些参与竟拍的团队

78
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
有两种选择方法

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
实际上是

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
出价和用于出价的资金

81
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,640
所以

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,879
首先，如果您有一个账户

83
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
比如 Kusama 的话，您有一个

84
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
持有 KSM 的钱包，想使用于

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
此竟拍活动

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
而您不需要让社区成员来参与

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,400
这可以成为一种选择。

88
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
在多数的情况下

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
很可能是

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
这里的第二个选择，那就是使用

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
众贷模块

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
在这种情况下，您实际上是这样的

93
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
在Kusama的KSM众贷

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
或DOT众贷的情况下

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
来自您的社区成员和您

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,440
基本上一起筹集资金，这样您就可以了

97
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,519
可以使用

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,000
在平行链插槽竟拍中。

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
这种情况会发生多长的时间？

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
平行链插槽竟拍是一次性而

101
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
而各别进行的，但它其实是

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
大约每两周一次，所以

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
在Polkadot和Kusama生态系统中

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,720
这些事情将会以此

105
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
基础上继续地进行

106
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
所以，众贷首先是

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
like i said are used

108
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
for the opening bid in an auction so

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
teams will

110
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
crowdsource these tokens and then use

111
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
them in that parachain auction at the

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
next step.

113
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
If you're a user and you contribute KSM

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
to a Kusama parachain or if you

115
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,400
contribute DOT to a Polkadot parachain

116
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
you're essentially agreeing to locking

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
those tokens for the duration of that

118
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
parachain slot.

119
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
In the example that I used earlier

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
let's assume 24 months

121
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,720
then after 24 months your original

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,799
principle is returned back to you so

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
it's essentially no loss and a much more

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,200
ethical model

125
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
than we've seen in the past with things

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
like ICOs because in this case

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
you really hold the team accountable for

128
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
actually delivering on their

129
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,120
vision in their white paper because they

130
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
need to add value to their network

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
because they're actually not raising

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
any funds directly from you as the

133
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,160
community member.

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
Last, I kind of hinted at this

135
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
just now but

136
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
the funds that are contributed in

137
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
KSM or in DOT

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
are never touched by the team so there's

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
no worries about

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,440
teams raising money and running away

141
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
with it not delivering on what they

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
promised. All

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
the interests are really aligned here

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
and the team is really held accountable.

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
In the crowdloan,

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
this is kind of what it looks like.

147
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
You've got multiple teams

148
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
crowdsourcing KSM or DOT from their

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
communities

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
and that leads into the paratrain slot

151
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
auction.

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Everything that was raised in that

153
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,400
crowdloan stage is

154
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,320
is not accessible to the team but

155
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
they can actually use that

156
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
in their parachain slot auction. So you

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
can think of it like a poker table

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
at the beginning of the auction all

159
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
these teams will basically go all in

160
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,600
with the funds that they raised in

161
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,400
their crowdloan.

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Then how do we determine the winner?

163
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
When the auction starts we will know the

164
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
open time

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
here in the green, and we will know the

166
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,639
close time in the orange over here

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
and the most exciting point will be when

168
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,440
we hit this close time

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,759
the Kusama or Polkadot relay chain

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
itself will randomly select a time

171
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
that determines the end time, this red

172
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
bar here. So in this

173
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
example you've got Parachain B bidding,

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
Parachain C bidding,

175
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,479
Parachain A bidding.... E and F

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
beat A in terms of number of KSM but the

177
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,280
winner was determined at this red line

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
so

179
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
the highest bidder was Parachain A.

180
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
This is called an unpermissioned candle auction

181
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
and it incentivizes teams to bid

182
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
as high as they can as early as they can

183
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
instead of waiting until the end like

184
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
you might have seen on ebay

185
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,319
where people try to

186
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,240
snipe at the end and get the highest bid.

187
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
This is a full walkthrough of this

188
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
whole process. You've got

189
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
users over here contributing KSM they

190
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,720
contribute in this example to Karura

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,199
500,000 KSM. Then Karua

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
wins the first slot on Kusama and then

193
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,600
begins its launch process so

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
all of the KSM that was crowdsourced in

195
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
this original

196
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
crowdloan period is then locked in the

197
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,759
core

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,919
Kusama relay chain and then KAR

199
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
is then distributed, the native token of

200
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
Karura (KAR) is distributed to the

201
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
crowdloan contributors

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
and then at the same time

203
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
Karura is also launching so

204
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,039
the Karura stablecoin, the liquid KSM staking,

205
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
as well as

206
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,479
the Karura AMM-DEX, the Karura DEX

207
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
all go live on top of Karura

208
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
when this happens. At the end of

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,039
the parachain slot all of the KSM is

210
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,880
returned to the

211
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,400
supporters. Now the

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
last question that people sometimes

213
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
have is: 'What happens at the end of that

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
slot?' In this example, let's say

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
that it was a one-year parachain slot

216
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,479
the KSM is returned to the original

217
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
crowdloan supporters and then there's

218
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
three options for

219
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
any team to kind of maintain their

220
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
access to the relay chain.

221
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
First is to host another crowdloan and

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,680
do another parachain auction,

223
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
second is to self fund. Karura and

224
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
Acala will both have a decentralized

225
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
sovereign wealth fund

226
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
and over time that will

227
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
continue to build and build

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
so that we can become sovereign and

229
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
self-sustainable and actually

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,440
bid with our own treasury our own

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
sovereign wealth fund

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
for future slots, and then the third

233
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,800
option

234
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
there's probably several wiki articles

235
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
and videos that you could watch

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
about this but, the other option is

237
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
to become a parathread, which

238
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
just means that you have a little

239
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
bit less access..

240
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
less frequent access to the relay

241
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,039
chain itself.

242
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
So that's it in about eight minutes.

243
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
Hopefully you learned something. Let me

244
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,759
know if you have any questions.

245
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
Thank you, bye.
