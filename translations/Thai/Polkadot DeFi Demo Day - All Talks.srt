1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,920
เราจะไปลงรายละเอียดเชิงลึกกัน

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,040
โดยฉันจะแสดงให้เห็นถึงเบื้องหลัง

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,440
เจาะลึกเข้าไปในส่วนลึกของ parachains

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,799
ดังนั้นเราจะพูดถึง

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,240
การอนุมัติการตรวจสอบ

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,279
parachains ทำงานอย่างไร

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
สิ่งที่ยากที่สุดเกี่ยวกับ

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,080
parachains

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,600
และกับระบบ blockchain ทุกประเภท ๆ

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
คือ

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
คุณรู้ว่านี่เป็นปัญหา

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,279
ที่แท้จริงที่ว่าคุณ

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,199
จะรักษาความปลอดภัยได้อย่างไร

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640
เหนือชาร์ดที่แตกต่างกันทั้งหมดโดยที่ทุกคนไม่ได้ตรวจสอบ

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
ทุกอย่างโดยที่ตัวตรวจสอบความถูกต้อง

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
ไม่ได้ตรวจสอบพาราเชนทั้งหมด

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
เพราะเมื่อ คุณจะไม่ปรับขนาดให้เหมาะสม

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
คุณรู้ว่าคุณแค่ใช้งานโหนดเต็ม 100

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
โหนดบนคอมพิวเตอร์

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
นั่นไม่ใช่สิ่งที่เราต้องการ

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
เรามีโปรโตคอลทั้งหมด

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
ที่เรียกว่าการตรวจสอบการอนุมัติ

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
ฉันจะเข้าเนื้อหาที่ละน้อย

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,320
จากนั้นฉันจะแสดงตัวอย่าง

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,840
การทำงาน

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
บนเครือข่ายทดสอบในเครื่อง

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
ดังนั้นฉันจึงจะ pull request

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,719
ตอนนี้มันถูกรวมเข้าด้วยกันแล้ว

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
มันมีโค้ดเยอะมาก ประมาณ 7,000 บรรทัด

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
ฉันไม่รู้ ฉันเห็น

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,760
สิ่งที่ฉันเห็นบนหน้าจอของฉัน

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,479
เป็นรูปสี่เหลี่ยมผืนผ้าสีเทาที่มุมบนขวา

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
ปิดส่วนหนึ่งของสไลด์ของฉัน

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
ฉันไม่แน่ใจ คุณเห็นมันไหม

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
 

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,880
มันไม่ควรอยู่ที่นั่น

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
ฉันคิดว่านั่นเป็นข้อผิดพลาด

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
ของการแชร์หน้าจอ

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,640
ฉันคิดว่าฉันเห็นสีเทารอบๆ โอเค

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,240
ด้านบนขวา ดี ฉันไม่รู้ว่า

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
ฉันรู้วิธีเขียนโค้ด parachains

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
ฉันไม่รู้วิธีแก้ สี่เหลี่ยมผืนผ้า นี้ออกยังไง

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,119
อดทนกับฉันหน่อย

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
อืม เรามีโค้ดประมาณ 7,000 บรรทัดที่นี่

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
 

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,040
เราเพิ่มเข้าไป คุณรู้มากกว่านั้น

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,240
เกี่ยวกับการทดสอบและสิ่งต่างๆ แต่คุณรู้ว่า

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
มีโค้ดจำนวนมาก

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,840
คุณจะเห็น pink bleeding

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,360
wojack action

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,119
หากคุณกำลังพยายามอ่านโค้ดนี้

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,600
มันจะเป็น

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
 

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
ให้เจาะลึกลงไปเยอะ ดังนั้นฉันจึงทำสไลด์นำเสนอนี้

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
ในขั้นต้นเพื่อเรียงลำดับ

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
ว่าคุณสมบัติหลักของโค้ดนี้คืออะไร

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,840
โดยที่ไม่

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,079
ใส่โค้ดทั้งหมดด้วยตัวมันเอง

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
 

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
ทำไมมันถึงเดินหน้าไปได้มาก

61
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,200
เรามาถอยกลับกันไปที่เป้าหมายของเรา

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
คือการสร้างความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจสำหรับ

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,160
polkadot พาราเชนส์

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,800
เรามีแนวคิดเรื่อง

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
ความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจ ซึ่งฉัน

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
ไม่รู้จริงๆ ว่าทำไมมันถึง

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
แสดงแค่บางส่วนของสไลด์สุดท้าย

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,800
ที่อยู่ตรงกลาง

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,200
ของสไลด์ปัจจุบัน เป้าหมายของเราคือ

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,879
สร้างความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจสำหรับ parachains

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
นั่นคือ อืม ทรัพย์สินของคุณ

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
ทำให้แน่ใจว่าเราสามารถ

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,319
ระบุได้ว่าผู้ตรวจสอบความถูกต้อง

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,519
คนใดประพฤติตัวมุ่งร้ายและ จัดการมัน เพราะ

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,040
เมื่อคุณอยู่ในระบบการ stake

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
ฉันแน่ใจว่าพวกคุณหลายคนกำลังทำการ stake อยู่

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
คุณรู้ว่าถ้าผู้ตรวจสอบความถูกต้อง

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
คุณกำลังเสนอชื่อหรือ ถ้าคุณเป็น

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,440
validator

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
ที่ทำตัวไม่ถูกต้อง คุณกำลังจะ

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
จัดการ

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
ดังนั้นมันจึงใช้ validators เพียงไม่กี่ตัว

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
ในการเอา parachain block ไปที่

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
relay chain

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
แต่เราสนใจที่จะ slashing

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
parachain block

87
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
ผู้สนับสนุนของบล็อก Parachain

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
เหล่านั้นเมื่อบล็อก Parachain

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
เหล่านั้นไม่ได้ถูกกล่าวถึง

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
เพียงใน relay chain แต่สิ่งที่เราจะ

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
เรียก

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
พร้อมใช้งาน ดังนั้นหลังจากที่พวกเขาได้แจกจ่าย

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,840
ข้อมูลไปยังเครื่องมือตรวจสอบความถูกต้องอื่น ๆ ทั้งหมด เพื่อให้พวกเขา

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
ามารถตรวจสอบสิ่งเหล่านั้นอีกครั้ง

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,440
อืม นี่เป็นเส้นทางคร่าวๆ

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
ของบล็อก parachain เรามีหลายสิ่งหลายอย่าง

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,480
ที่เกิดขึ้นพร้อมกัน ดังนั้น parachains

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,480
 

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
แต่เรารู้ก่อนว่าคุณมีบล็อก parachain

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
สีชมพูซึ่ง

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
ซึ่งได้รับการสนับสนุน แล้วมันก็

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,040
ถูกกล่าวถึงใน relay chain จากนั้น

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,040
มันก็

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,239
พร้อมใช้งาน เพื่อให้ผู้สนับสนุนเริ่มต้นเหล่านั้น

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,239
แจกจ่ายข้อมูล

106
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,720
ไปยังตัวตรวจสอบความถูกต้องอื่น ๆ ทั้งหมด

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
เพื่อให้สามารถกู้คืนข้อมูลได้ในภายหลัง

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
และคุณรู้หลังจากที่คุณมี

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
 

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,959
บล็อกสีม่วงในนั้น คุณก็มี

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
บล็อกสีเขียวด้วย ในนั้น

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
ฉันจึงใช้ด้านซ้ายของบล็อก relay chain

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
เพื่อระบุสิ่งที่ได้รับ

114
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,400
การสนับสนุนและไม่ได้กล่าวถึง

115
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,319
และไม่พร้อมใช้งาน จากนั้นทางด้านขวา

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
ของบล็อกอ้างอิงที่ได้รับการ

117
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,920
สนับสนุนและพร้อมใช้งานเพื่อให้คุณเห็น

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
เป็นอันดับแรก มันไปที่บล็อกสีม่วง

119
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,360
แล้วก็บล็อกสีเขียว

120
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
จากนั้นทั้งคู่ก็อยู่

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
ทางด้านขวาสุดที่

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,840
หัวของเชนนั้น

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
ฉันอยากจะทบทวนอัลกอริธึม grandpa

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
 

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,799
เล็กน้อย

126
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,600
วิธีที่grandpaทำงานคือ

127
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,040
มันมีโหนดที่ลงคะแนนเสียง

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
สิ่งที่พวกเขาคิดว่าเป็นเชนที่ดีที่สุด

129
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
คือเชนที่ยาวที่สุดที่

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
พวกเขาเคยเห็นบ่อยๆ

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
แล้ว grandpa จะคำนวนหาข้อสรุป

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
ให้คุณรู้ว่าข้อสรุปที่เป็นฉันทามติเป็นอย่างไร

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
อะไรคือห่วงโซ่ที่ยาวที่สุด

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
ที่ทุกคนเห็นด้วย

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
เหมือนกับ

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,199
คำนำหน้าทั่วไปนั้น มันเป็นวิธีที่ฉัน

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
ชอบอธิบาย ถ้าคุณ

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
ดูไอเดียของ bitcoin

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
อืมด้วยหลักฐานการทำงาน bitcoin

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,759
หรือหลักฐานการทำงาน ethereum หากคุณเพียงแค่ตัด

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
บล็อกของ chainออกมา หก หรือสิบ บล็อค

142
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,479
บล็อคของมัน

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,680
จะมีสายเดียวกัน

144
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,880
ตราบใดที่คุณเพิกเฉย

145
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,000
ต่อบล็อกล่าสุดเหล่านั้น

146
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,479
แต่สิ่งที่ grandpa ทำคือมันทำให้

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
เป็นมติที่เป็นเอกฉันท์ เหนือสิ่งอื่นใด

148
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,759
คุณจึงสามารถรับรู้ได้ทันทีเมื่อ

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
โหนดต่าง ๆ เห็นด้วย

150
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,880
ห่วงโซ่ที่คุณรู้จัก ในส่วนของ

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
เชนนั้น

152
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,360
พวกมันทั้งหมดมีความเห็นพ้องต้องกัน

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
ดังนั้นคุณจะเห็นได้ว่าโหนดทั้งสาม

154
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
นี้มีความคิดที่แตกต่างกัน

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
สิ่งที่อยู่ตรงหัวของ

156
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,080
เชน แต่ทั้งหมดตกลงกันในบล็อก a b

157
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
และ c เพื่อให้สามารถ

158
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
ถือว่าเสร็จสิ้นแล้ว

159
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
ดังนั้นนี่คือการแสดงอีกรูปแบบหนึ่ง

160
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
ว่าสี่ช่วง บล็อก แรกนี้ได้รับการสรุปทั้งหมดแล้ว

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
โดยที่แม้ว่าจะมี

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,880
บล็อกเชนอื่นๆ หลุดออกมาจากพวกนั้น

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,479
สิ่งที่เราพยายามจะทำคือ

164
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,199
ขียนกฎการลงคะแนนเสียงที่กำหนดเอง

165
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,840
สำหรับ grandpa ดังนั้น แนวคิดก็คือ

166
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
 

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,479
ไม่เป็นไรถ้าบล็อก Parachain

168
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
ที่ไม่ดีเข้าไปในสาขาของสายรีเลย์

169
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
แต่มันไม่สามารถเข้าไปใน

170
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,160
สาขาสุดท้ายได้ของห่วงโซ่relay chain ได้ ดังนั้นมันจึงไม่

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
ได้รับการโหวตภายใน grandpa

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
ดังนั้นเราจึงมีเชน สุดท้าย เรามี

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,840
พื้นที่โหวต บน grandpa ที่ใช้สำหรับการโหวต

174
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
บนสิ่งที่มีบนบล็อก parachain

175
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,039
ที่เป็นส่วนดีทั้งหมด แล้วเรา

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
ก็มีรหัสตรวจสอบการอนุมัติที่

177
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
ซึ่งเป็น

178
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,039
พื้นที่ดูเหมือนว่า เราไม่แน่ใจ

179
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
ด้วยซ้ำว่าบล็อกของ Parachainที่อ้างอิง

180
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,520
ภายในบล็อก relay chain

181
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
เหล่านี้ดีหรือไม่ แต่อาจเป็นเช่นนั้น

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,080
นี่คือ

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
จุดที่มีการตรวจสอบจริงเกิดขึ้น

184
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
ทางด้านขวา

185
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
ตรงกลางนั้น เหมือนที่เราคิด

186
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
เป็นสิ่งที่ดีและเราจะลงคะแนนเพื่อ

187
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,639
ดูว่าคุณรู้ว่าสิ่งที่ได้รับการสรุปแล้ว

188
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
ด้านซ้ายสุดคือ

189
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,520
สิ่งที่ได้รับการสรุปแล้ว

190
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
นั่นคือกฎการลงคะแนน

191
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
 

192
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
ถ้าคุณ กำลังเขียนโค้ด

193
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,160
สำหรับ

194
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
กฎการสรุปผลของเราคือการโหวตให้เสร็จสิ้น

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
สมมติว่าบล็อกนี้

196
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
อยู่ตรงกลาง

197
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,000
ก็ต่อเมื่อบล็อก parachain สีเขียวนั้นดี

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,199
แต่

199
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ก็ต่อเมื่อบล็อก para chain สีม่วง

200
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
นั้นดีเช่นกัน

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,759
นั่นคือ อืม

202
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
ประเด็นคือคุณ

203
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,000
ไม่อยากโหวตบล็อก

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
เว้นแต่บล็อกนั้นและทั้งหมดนั้น

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,360
ก่อนหน้านั้น

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,280
ดีอยู่แล้ว ดังนั้นฉันจะไปได้

207
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
ลึกกว่านี้ด้วยสิ่งนี้ แต่ฉันจะ

208
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,639
จะหยุดหลังจากสไลด์

209
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,479
นี้เพื่อสรุปสิ่งที่เรา

210
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,479
พูดคุยเกี่ยวกับการตรวจสอบการอนุมัติ

211
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,919
คือเราต้องการให้เครือข่ายสรุป

212
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,800
เฉพาะบล็อกที่มี

213
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,639
บล็อก Parachain ที่ดีที่เรา

214
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,000
ควบคุมพฤติกรรมที่บันทึกอย่างซื่อสัตย์

215
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,440
แน่นอนเรามี

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
เรามีข้อสันนิษฐานนี้

217
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
ว่าจะมีการโจมตีบน

218
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
เครือข่ายมากถึงหนึ่งในสามของโหนดอาจ

219
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
กำลังโจมตีเครือข่าย

220
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
สิ่งที่เราจะทำคือผลิต

221
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
กฎการลงคะแนนที่สร้างพฤติกรรม

222
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
การสรุปผลที่เราต้องการในเครือข่าย

223
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
ซึ่งเป็นอีกครั้ง

224
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
ที่เราทำการต่อบล็อกลูกโซ่รีเลย์ให้เสร็จเท่านั้น

225
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,160
ที่มี

226
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
บล็อกพาราเชนที่ดี

227
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,720
ขอสรุปเป็นภาษาอังกฤษ

228
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,759
เราต้องการเลือกบล็อก b เพื่อลงคะแนนให้ a

229
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
บล็อกโซ่รีเลย์

230
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,880
ซึ่งจะเป็นห่วงโซ่

231
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,160
ที่ยาวที่สุด ที่เราจะไปหาตัวตั้งตนแรก

232
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,400
ของเชนนั้น ว่า

233
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
บล็อกทั้งหมดระหว่างบล็อกสุดท้าย

234
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,160
และ

235
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,440
บล็อกตั้งต้น ที่ดี

236
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
parachain ที่ได้รับคัดเลือก

237
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,440
แล้วเราก็โหวตให้จบเรื่องนั้นแต่

238
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
นี่เป็นเพียงช่วงสั้นๆ ดังนั้นสิ่งที่ฉัน

239
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
จะทำเดี๋ยวนี้

240
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
เข้าเทอร์มินัล และฉันมี

241
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
บางอย่างกำลังทำงาน

242
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,560
การหกโหนด nevalidators รันบน testnet

243
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
สามพาราเชน

244
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
ที่เราเห็นจริงๆคือ เอ่อ

245
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
validators

246
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
รวมถึง parachain

247
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
ใน relay chain

248
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
อืม มันกำลังใส่พวกนี้ลงใน

249
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
relay chain และพวกมันจะ

250
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
กระจายข้อมูลที่มีอยู่

251
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
แล้วมันก็เลือกตรวจสอบ

252
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
บล็อคเหล่านั้นเองแ

253
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
การถ่ายทอดงานที่พวกเขา

254
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
ที่ได้รับการตรวจสอบแล้ว

255
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
การกู้คืนข้อมูล การทำการตรวจสอบ

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,120
ตรวจสอบพวกเขาแล้ว

257
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
เอ่อ การถ่ายทอดการอนุมัติการโหวต ดังนั้นคุณ

258
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,879
เห็นว่ามีแอคชั่นเยอะที่นี่

259
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
เช่น

260
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
โหนดบอกว่าโอเคฉันถูกกำหนดให้

261
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,719
ตรวจสอบสิ่งนี้และโหนดอื่น ๆ

262
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
บอกว่าโอเค คุณได้รับมอบหมายให้ตรวจสอบ

263
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,120
ดังนั้น ฉันจะไม่ทำมัน

264
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,959
โอเค ถ้าอย่างนั้นพวกเขาตรวจสอบแล้วพวกเขา

265
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,039
ถ่ายทอดงานเพื่อให้มี

266
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,000
กิจกรรมที่วุ่นวายอย่างต่อเนื่อง

267
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,959
กำลังเกิดขึ้น

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,839
นั่นคือการจบบล็อก parachain

269
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,200
และสิ่งที่เราเห็น

270
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,320
คือว่า นี้

271
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,320
เป็นตัวแทนของไลค์ซึ่งรีเลย์ เชน

272
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
เรา ถือว่ามันดี

273
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
เราสามารถเห็นเหมือนภายในหน้าต่าง 50 บล็อกนี้

274
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,640
จาก 312 ถึง 263

275
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,040
บล็อกเหล่านั้นทั้งหมดได้รับ

276
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,399
อนุมัติอย่างเพียงพอ

277
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,000
โดย uh validators คุณจะได้รู้บางครั้ง

278
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
คุณจะเห็นเหมือนอันแรกไม่ได้รับ

279
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
อนุมัติแต่ได้รับการอนุมัติจริง

280
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,320
ค่อนข้างเร็วและจะ

281
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
อาจะถึง สามพาราเชน

282
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
 

283
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
บล็อกต่อ relay chain บล็อก ตั้งแต่เราเริ่ม

284
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
ทำงานเป็นเครือข่ายสาม parachains

285
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,360
อย่างไรก็ตามนั่นคือ คำอธิบายสั้นๆ

286
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,680
เป็นการนำเสนอ แบบเร็วๆ เกี่ยวกับการอนุมัติ

287
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,200
การตรวจสอบ เอ่อ เป็นหัวข้อที่สนุกที่จะเจาะลึกลงไป

288
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
มีข้อมูลมากมาย

289
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
มันอยู่ในคู่มือผู้ปฏิบัติ แต่สำหรับ

290
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
  

291
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,839
ฉันจะสรุปมันและส่งมอบให้กับ

292
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
สมาชิกชุมชนที่ยอดเยี่ยมของเรา

293
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,760
สวัสดีทุกคน ฉันคือ aiden จาก snowfall

294
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
และตามที่อธิบายไว้เรากำลัง สร้าง สะพาน

295
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
ระหว่าง polkadot และ ethereum

296
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
มีความพิเศษบางอย่างที่น่าสนใจไม่เหมือนใคร

297
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
ของลักษณะสะพานของเราในเรื่องนั้น

298
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,920
เป็นการกระจายอำนาจแบบโปร่งแสงอย่างเต็มที่และ

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
เราบรรลุสิ่งนั้นโดยการทำงานอย่างเต็มที่สำหรับ

300
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,080
ลูกค้าทั้งสองเชน

301
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,600
uh so on polkadot there's a like line

302
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,920
for ethereum and on ethereum there's a

303
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
polka dot for there's a like line for

304
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
polka dots

305
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
another aspect is that it's general

306
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,240
purpose so i'm gonna jump right into the

307
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,600
demo so i can show you

308
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
how where we're at and how things are

309
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
working so the first thing you can see

310
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
here

311
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
is i'm busy looking at the logs of our

312
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
relayer the relayer

313
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,640
is this microservice that runs in the

314
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
middle of the two that's responsible for

315
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,640
sending state back and forward between

316
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
the chains um it's not at all trusted

317
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,720
anyone can run the re-layer

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
uh the relay code can be malicious um it

319
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
can be modified and that won't

320
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,480
compromise the protocoin anyway

321
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
at the moment you can see the relay is

322
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,600
watching for new ethereum blocks and

323
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,519
headers

324
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
and it's taking those ethereum headers

325
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,079
and relaying them over to substrate

326
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,959
to our power chain and essentially with

327
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,279
every header

328
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,800
the pirate chain is doing a full like

329
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
line check of the proof of work in that

330
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,880
header

331
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
making sure that it's like the longest

332
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,279
heaviest chain on ethereum

333
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,680
and then updating the latest known

334
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,360
header chain state on ethereum

335
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
we have a similar process for going in

336
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
the other direction where we send

337
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
updates

338
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,279
of what's happening on the polka dot

339
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
relay chain over to ethereum and

340
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,560
incorporate them into smart contracts

341
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
i'm not demanding that today but we're

342
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,160
almost done with it

343
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
and so yeah and so we've got a little

344
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
front-end demo that i can

345
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,839
show you there's kind of a few caveats

346
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
to it so firstly

347
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,920
a lot of this is in work in progress

348
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
states so there may be a little a

349
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,200
few issues here and there and the

350
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
front-end demo especially

351
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
has still got a lot of ux polish to do

352
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
so

353
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,320
the ui and ux is not uh fully formalized

354
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,040
yet

355
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,240
so don't uh judge us based on that uh

356
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,640
primarily we want to focus on the

357
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,040
functionality for you to see

358
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
so so here we've got our snowbridge demo

359
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,640
page

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,680
you can see i've got my ethereum wallet

361
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
connected

362
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
and my polka dot wallet connected and i

363
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
already have some heath and some snow

364
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
eats that i've got from having

365
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,600
transferred it over

366
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
this first screen when you refresh the

367
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,240
page and open it up

368
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,920
um is one which you can use to send your

369
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
ethereum across to polka dot

370
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
so here for example i'm going to send

371
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
five ether cross

372
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,880
um it's intended to be like really

373
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,839
simple your address is automatically

374
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,959
populated it's just

375
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
put in the mouse and click the send

376
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,040
button and then your metamod shows up to

377
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
deposit your eth

378
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,720
i'm going to confirm and the transaction

379
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,079
is submitted

380
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,839
uh this is not currently connected to

381
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,079
robsten i'm running this locally

382
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
research scan but here you can see the

383
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,880
transaction list and what's happening

384
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,560
and so first thing we're doing is we're

385
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
waiting for the transaction to get

386
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
confirmed on ethereum

387
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
and when that happens this bubble should

388
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,639
go green and it goes on to the next step

389
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,839
there we go we're done this next step is

390
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,240
about relaying the message to polkadot

391
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,079
so it logs its processing blocks and

392
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
the relayer just got a message you can

393
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,200
see here and it's sending that message

394
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,200
over to polkadot

395
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,399
and we've got a green bubble it's just

396
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
been relayed to pokedot

397
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
if we go look at our power chain you can

398
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,279
see there's been recently

399
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,680
i think this is the new one the ether

400
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
event and ethereum has been minted to my

401
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
polka dot account

402
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,720
and it should be good so we just sent

403
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,279
five ether cross

404
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,880
so when i refresh you should see my eat

405
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,279
amount got up by five and my ethereum

406
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
want to go down by five

407
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
we're going to incorporate like

408
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
automated refresh in time

409
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
uh and there you go so now i'm down to

410
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,360
92 east and

411
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,880
five months have gone across and now

412
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,600
exists on polka dot

413
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,920
on our power chain now i want to send

414
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
the

415
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,079
eve back so i just tap this button to do

416
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
the reverse flow

417
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,680
and i can go again and say i want to

418
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
send five snowys back

419
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,839
and click the send button here now my

420
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,440
pokedot wallet comes up and

421
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
i'm going to sign the transaction and

422
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
send it across it's submitted

423
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,920
and now we're waiting for it to get

424
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,199
included in our pocket block so if we go

425
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
look at our power chain

426
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
you can see oh there's the ether.burned

427
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,480
event so

428
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
the message has just been burned and

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
included in our power chain

430
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
the front end should detect this in a

431
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
minute there we go

432
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,560
and now we wait for it to get relayed

433
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
over to the ethereum side

434
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
so again i'm going to watch the relay

435
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
and this takes a little longer because

436
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
our process for relaying across is a

437
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,240
little bit more complicated

438
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,800
essentially we have a custom commitment

439
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
scheme

440
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,480
that our power chain uses to create

441
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,839
commitments for

442
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,120
the messages that come through and so on

443
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,279
ethereum we can kind of verify these

444
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,920
commitments in a much more efficient way

445
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
that allows us to save gas and uh

446
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
optimize and so

447
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
once every 10 also blocks on our power

448
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,839
chain these commitments are all joined

449
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
together and sent across and here you

450
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079
can

451
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
you can see the relay just found a

452
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,760
commitment and

453
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
it related over to ethereum and you can

454
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,880
see it submitted the transaction to

455
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
ethereum with this new commitment which

456
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,519
includes a bundle of bunch of messages

457
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
and if we go back you can see all the

458
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
levels are green the

459
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
attraction is done and so now if i

460
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
refresh you'll see

461
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
my balances have gone back to what they

462
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,519
originally were

463
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,120
let's see yeah there we go so now i've

464
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
got back to 97

465
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
and back down to two snow ethan so

466
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
that's a full round trip of ethereum

467
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,639
um we've also got functionality working

468
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,480
for erc20 tokens so locally i've got

469
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,600
this like test token over here

470
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
set up and developed and so i can demo

471
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
sending the test token back and forth

472
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
it's very much a similar process

473
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,639
with tokens of course first you need to

474
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,279
do approval so you can see i've got 100

475
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,800
balance

476
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,399
i've already approved 40 tokens

477
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,959
beforehand just to make it easier to

478
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
demo

479
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,160
and so i can put in the amount and send

480
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,160
the tokens across

481
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,560
again we get the same nice progress

482
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
bubbles that show you each step of the

483
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
way

484
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
we're also going to be adding links so

485
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,000
whenever you click on one of these

486
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
you'll get linked out to an actual block

487
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,880
explorer so where you can like really

488
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,399
introspect things and

489
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
uh just from a kind of user's

490
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
perspective help users see

491
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,279
exactly where their funds are going and

492
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
how they're being handled so so that

493
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,000
there's no

494
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
uncertainty from the user perspective

495
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,160
now you can see

496
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
the erc20 minted has just happened and

497
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,320
been included in our power chain

498
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,399
and so if i go and refresh you should

499
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,680
see my erc20 balance

500
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,680
uh drop down to 20.

501
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,079
if i go to here yeah my erc20 balance is

502
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
only

503
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,759
uh so it went down from 100 to 80 and my

504
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,000
allowed balance went down from 40 to 20.

505
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,920
if i go to the reversed to send the 20

506
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,519
back

507
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,560
and send it sign the transaction

508
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,000
and now we've got to wait for that whole

509
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,880
special commitment scheme relaying

510
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,199
process that i mentioned to happen again

511
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,959
for example if multiple people are using

512
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,160
the system at the same time

513
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
then their messages will also get

514
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
bundled together into a single

515
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,279
commitment

516
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
for much cheaper gas price optimizations

517
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,800
that commitment is also verified and

518
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
through the verification process we

519
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,160
verify both

520
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
uh what's happening on our power chain

521
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
through our custom commitments as well

522
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
as

523
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,040
what's happening on the polka dot relay

524
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,440
chain through verifying

525
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
big grandpa relay chain block production

526
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
process

527
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
we should see the new commitment come

528
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
across in a bit

529
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,160
and if you look at our power chain you

530
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,799
can see this burned message

531
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:07,199
happened and went through

532
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
so this could take a few more blocks um

533
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
but essentially yeah that's the full

534
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,559
process

535
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
for ethereum and erc20 tokens

536
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,640
um another interesting thing to point

537
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,360
out is that

538
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,199
the core bridge protocol oh by the way

539
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
you can see here the computer was found

540
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,000
and this succeeded so if i refresh

541
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,280
i should be back to 40 uh sorry 200

542
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
tokens yeah there we go

543
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
um and so the the last interesting thing

544
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
to mention is

545
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
this application that we've developed is

546
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
just a demo for sending

547
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,200
heath and erc20 tokens back and forth

548
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,039
but really for the whole bridge and the

549
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
relay and all of our infrastructure

550
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,000
they don't know anything about assets

551
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
they don't know anything about tokens

552
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,840
it's implemented underneath

553
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
uh the application with completely

554
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,679
arbitrary messaging passing

555
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
and so we can develop any kind of

556
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,320
application cross chain application on

557
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
top of the bridge

558
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
it doesn't necessarily have to do

559
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,840
anything to do with asset transfer

560
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,600
it could be for nft it could be for defy

561
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,440
and you'll be able to send messages back

562
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,840
and forth for any kind of

563
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
application rather than just for a

564
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,280
simple asset transfer

565
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,960
and that's all really working today we

566
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,320
don't have a nice front-end demo of any

567
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
uh special etcetera

568
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,360
non-asset transfer stuff yet but we're

569
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,360
planning to do that next

570
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
and yeah that ends my demo so hey

571
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
i'm alex say i'm here together with dom

572
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,120
we're the two co-founders of interlay um

573
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,679
and we're building pokebtc to bring

574
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,360
bitcoin to the folklore d5 ecosystem

575
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,559
uh this is a project funded by the three

576
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,240
foundation grant and we're working

577
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,520
closely with op3 and parity

578
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,080
to make this possible so what is polka

579
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,240
bdc

580
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,520
pokevdc is the trust is a centralized

581
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
bit compile color bridge

582
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
built using the exclaim framework the

583
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
exclaim framework is something dominic

584
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,360
and i

585
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
designed and implemented during our

586
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,720
times at empire college um like then it

587
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,320
was just a research project and now

588
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,080
we're actually bringing this to live

589
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,320
on top of polka dots so what is polka bc

590
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,640
polka bbc is a one to one ptc packed

591
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,640
asset on polka dot this means that you

592
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
lock bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain

593
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,520
and you mint one to one backed polka bdc

594
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,120
now the trick here is that you lock this

595
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
with a collateralized vault it's an

596
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
intermediary that is fully

597
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
collateralized

598
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
and anyone can become a vault and it's a

599
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,320
fully essential set of participants

600
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
now once you have pokebc and polkadot

601
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,520
you can then move it to any power chain

602
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
and use it within any application within

603
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
the polkard ecosystem

604
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
and when you decide to go back you can

605
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
always get your bdc back

606
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,120
or if the system fails and everything

607
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
breaks down

608
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,720
you'll get reimbursed in collateral at a

609
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,120
beneficial rate so in the worst case you

610
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
actually make a profit

611
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
so why do we say that polka dc is the

612
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
most robust and most secure bridge in

613
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
the entire ecosystem not only

614
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,799
in polka dot it the reason for this is

615
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
it's trustless and it's decentralized

616
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,679
and it's trustless because you can

617
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,080
always redeem polka btc

618
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,360
for bdc or you'll get reimbursed in dots

619
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
at the beneficial rates

620
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,480
and is decentralized because there's no

621
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
central authority from the start it's

622
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,640
decentralized from the very beginning

623
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,559
anyone can become a vault over layer and

624
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,159
you can run your own vault as a user

625
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
there is no registration restrictions

626
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
anybody can participate

627
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,280
it's fully open now the only thing you

628
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
need to trust in when using this bridge

629
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
is that bitcoin works and the polka dot

630
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,799
works

631
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
so where are we at the moment actually

632
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,919
we've released beta this week and i'm

633
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
sure most of you have heard

634
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,280
it's been running for a few days and we

635
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
really welcome you to test it

636
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,679
what's going to happen next is we're

637
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,200
going to get in the feedback that you

638
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
provide we're going to finish the audits

639
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
keep testing keep making this system

640
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,679
robust

641
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,400
and then we'll be good to go to kusama

642
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,000
and polkadot whenever they're launched

643
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,320
so what's new in this version since the

644
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
last time we presented and since alpha

645
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,280
well we've released the vault and the

646
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
layer clients they're all open source

647
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,960
you can go ahead and run them now

648
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
we've done a full ux revamp we've got

649
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,520
100

650
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,799
bitcoin wallet support now for those of

651
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
you who remember alpha we had

652
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,480
not returned and we had limited wallet

653
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
support now that's all gone and we

654
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,640
support

655
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,640
all bitcoin wallets including harder

656
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
wallets like ledger and tresor

657
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,400
we've completed phase two of the audit

658
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,240
and we have a very detailed and new

659
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,919
documentation page including videos

660
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
which show you how to use the system

661
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
on the research integration side we've

662
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
launched rococo where

663
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,159
we've got xcmp to work and we're

664
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
actually really working on first

665
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
integrations with other power chains

666
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,919
and we've built the new key derivations

667
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,760
team this is essentially a very

668
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,679
technical component that makes usability

669
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,320
much better on the system

670
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
so what's next next of course more ux

671
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
improvements we're looking for your

672
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
feedback

673
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,200
we'll do more testing more audits and

674
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,640
then also make sure that we have

675
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,120
governance on the system

676
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,000
on the research side um the next steps

677
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,400
are integrations with nbcd5 products

678
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
um we'll then add multi-oracle support

679
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,679
and then two pretty cool things that are

680
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,600
coming up are staking derivatives where

681
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,600
vaults will be able to earn additional

682
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,000
rewards under collateral

683
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,679
and we're working on x 2.0 which will

684
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
make the system much more secure

685
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,799
and also reduce the collateral and

686
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,159
essentially

687
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,440
when this works it'll be a

688
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
groundbreaking change to the entire

689
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,400
bridge ecosystem

690
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,120
so beta is live and please

691
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,960

and i'm happy to announce that polkadot

694
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120

698
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
so i'm heading over to dom now i hope

699
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,280
he's online

700
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,600
come here i'm perfect

701
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
let me share the screen real quick okay

702
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,159
cool all right so thanks for

703
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,440
the uh intro alexei and then now what

704
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,559
i'm gonna show is the demo

705
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,919
and this is uh this is gonna be an

706
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,159
interesting demo because

707
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,159
i'm demoing directly on our live beta

708
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,280
system uh so it depends a bit

709
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,960
what load we currently have but if you

710
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,640
if you hit our pta website you

711
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,000
will be greeted basically with this so

712
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,080
we currently have

713
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,360
8.1 pokebtc logged and

714
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
or issued and we have a bunch of

715
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,200
collateral

716
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,120
um fair note this is all like fake dots

717
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
just for testing purposes and also the

718
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,679
bitcoin are not real

719
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,280
um but we are using the actual bitcoin

720
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
test network and what i'm going to do

721
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,360
now

722
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,039
is basically uh walk you through the

723
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,960
through the flow real quick um so

724
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,120
basically what you would do here

725
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
is you would enter the amount of poco

726
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,360
btc that you want to receive

727
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,960
and uh you get your own like a bridge

728
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
fee here this is still kind of work in

729
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
progress so

730
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
this will likely change from mainnet a

731
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,000
small security deposit to kind of

732
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,640
prevent briefing of the vaults because

733
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
it's kind of

734
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
decentralized system and then it shows

735
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,600
you the total deposit

736
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,280
and what i just do is i hit confirm

737
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,240
and then my poco.js pops up

738
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
i sign the transaction and this gets

739
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,000
then mined

740
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
i think since we're on the actual beta

741
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
life test network

742
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,279
there's a slight delay here at the

743
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
moment but what's happening in the

744
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,440
background right now

745
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,360
is we are doing this kind of magic trick

746
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,679
where a vault gets a new btc address so

747
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
for every request we are using a new

748
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,120
deposit address for the vault

749
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,440
and we are creating this on chain and

750
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,679
once this is done you will see basically

751
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,200
here and it will ask you to actually

752
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,840
send a

753
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
a bitcoin transfer with that amount to

754
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,159
this

755
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,159
specific vault address and you have to

756
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,720
do that within 24 hours

757
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
um slight side note we also added this

758
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,440
millibtc

759
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,120
because some bitcoin wallets show it

760
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
like that and you can also just scan a

761
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,480
qr code

762
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
um this literally works with any bitcoin

763
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
wallet that supports test net um

764
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
so electrum or you can even use your

765
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,360
hardware wallet so like ledger or tresor

766
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
um all works um i'm not going to make

767
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
the payment right now but

768
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,159
technically what i would do is like head

769
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,880
over to my electron do the payment

770
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,720
um anyway not doing that right now um

771
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,000
but basically what you're gonna see

772
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,000
is uh here are my requests that i made

773
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
that are still pending so that it asked

774
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,400
me to actually do the payment

775
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,679
uh which i didn't do yet but uh if i do

776
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
my payment

777
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,440
and then it gets confirmed on the

778
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
bitcoin blockchain

779
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,640
you will see that you receive this

780
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,760
request you get this

781
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,440
success message that you actually have

782
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,840
poco btc

783
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,000
and if you don't do that if you don't

784
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,520
make the payment within 24 hours

785
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,799
like the request will be cancelled and

786
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,240
you get a notification that it's

787
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,559
cancelled

788
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
um so yeah the the issue step is really

789
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,279
just this this this one screen

790
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,440
basically and then um as you can see up

791
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,000
here i i do have some pokeptc

792
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
so um what i can also do is i can just

793
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,120
do a redeem

794
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
and for this very purpose i'm actually

795
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,760
gonna um

796
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,360
i'm actually gonna create this uh

797
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,240
address now

798
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,799
and so electron gives me a new address

799
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,360
and

800
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,640
i'm gonna answer this uh let's say i'm

801
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,799
gonna

802
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,520
want to withdraw 0.003 poco btc

803
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,880
i'm going to hit confirm and again i

804
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,919
have to sign the transaction

805
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
and now what's happening in the

806
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
background is that one of our vaults

807
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,080
gets a

808
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,559
request and that it should send bitcoin

809
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,279
to me

810
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,640
to my address that i entered here and

811
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,120
this is going to pop up

812
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,559
also down there and once the bitcoin

813
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
transaction is actually included it's

814
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,720
going to be

815
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,919
added to to this one um

816
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,679
and what you can um so now actually the

817
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,679
what you just saw is basically the event

818
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
being processed on the power chain

819
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
um and once this is done you can also

820
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,520
easily expect this

821
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,120
uh inspect this using the boxstream

822
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,840
explorer

823
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,520
um i'm just gonna wait for another

824
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
second here to complete it yes so

825
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,919
basically

826
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,320
um this is just a confirmation um

827
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,520
and yeah so very simple issue in redeem

828
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
and very last thing

829
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
that i want to show is basically

830
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,480
transfer so once you have poker btc

831
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,760
what's going to happen is that you can

832
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
just transfer it around

833
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,000
and what you would enter here is uh

834
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,559
say your own um address so

835
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,320
maybe i'm just gonna copy paste my own

836
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,200
address here real quick

837
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,360
and um what we just added is basically

838
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,440
once xcm is fully functional you could

839
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,480
just transfer it over to a color

840
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,120
or to plasm or the other

841
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,000
projects that are basically live and

842
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,960
will be connected as power chains um

843
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,520
and i'm just gonna do the transfer here

844
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
now

845
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,919
uh oh okay i don't have enough money to

846
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,840
send this

847
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:40,000
this should work though and here we go

848
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,000
takes a second again for the transfer

849
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,320
and once it's completed it will show a

850
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,320
little

851
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,960
pop-up up here but again we're

852
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,440
live oh yeah there we go cool um yeah

853
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
and that's

854
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
uh that's basically it for the tech demo

855
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,840
um there's just

856
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,880
uh super small announcements um

857
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,039

858
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,559
we are very happy for all of the

859
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,120
feedback we are receiving

860
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,159
and hopefully can improve the system

861
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
even further

862
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,440

for

869
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,399
the first 500 users that do issue and

870
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,679

871
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,039
so please go on betapokerbtc.io and

872

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,360
and yeah that's thank you

874
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,919
awesome uh yeah so uh good morning

875
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,279
everyone

876
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:46,320
this is betty co-founder of akala and we

877
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,520
also have brian a co-founder and cto of

878
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,039
akala here today with us and he's

879
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,159
actually prepared a full

880
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,000
real cross chain uh d5 demo for you so

881
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,440
i'll just be very shocked and very brief

882
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
on my introduction

883
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
um i guess before diving in um because

884
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
the color has been around for

885
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,600
a while last year we run again the same

886
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,880
poker d5 demo

887
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,799
we've already run a full suite of d5

888
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
applications um and then it's great to

889
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,600
see this year uh everyone you know has

890
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,840
got their

891
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,799
uh application up and running and it

892
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,039
seems you know

893
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,840
we're very close to where the vision is

894
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,840
going to be

895
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,600
um and it's worth sharing you know what

896
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,679
we think the future uh

897
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,640
might look like um i think we've got you

898
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,720
know bitcoin

899
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
which is the calculator error that's one

900
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
thing and then ethereum

901
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,399
is perhaps the mainframe uh error of

902
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
blockchain and now i think we are

903
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,600
entering

904
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,080
uh the so-called cloud computing um

905
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,480
where everything as a service um

906
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,159
that's where we're heading i think um so

907
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,840
we kind of believe that you know future

908
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,399
will be uh multi-chain

909
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,279
um and then a specialization uh it's

910
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,360
gonna trump

911
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,399
uh generalization so you're gonna your

912
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,039
chain is gonna

913
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
specialize in a specific domain and do

914
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,080
certain things really well and solve

915
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,320
some problems very well

916
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
um and also change shouldn't be rigid it

917
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,440
should be upgradable

918
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,279
so that's that's what we think it's

919
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,520
going to happen and also

920
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,480
where we put our words out and build our

921
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,080
application

922
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,799
so this is the akala stack um if you

923
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,159
uh haven't seen this one yet so um akala

924
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
is still you know a full-fledged

925
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,279
blockchain

926
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,799
but it's ledger and trust is provided by

927
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
polkadot so this is what

928
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,159
uh you know i uh i originally you know

929
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,960
term as

930
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,919
uh network security uh or trust as a

931
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,919
service

932
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,840
um and also in the middle of it as

933
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,760
oakala's default offerings

934
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,000
uh they're offered you know a service

935
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,520
like customizable modules right um so

936
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,320
for example you know we've got this

937
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
multi-coleto uh stablecoin uh backed by

938
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,640
dot

939
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,880
liquid dot and then you also see you

940
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,399
know bitcoin like poker btc can be used

941
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
as collateral as well

942
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,000
um and then we our liquidation is

943
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,320
automatic and

944
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,799
use a hybrid of amm decks and auctions

945
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,080
um and um and then another thing that i

946
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,559
think brian would actually demo you

947
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,240
today is liquid staking so this is a

948
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,000
tokenized staked dot or l dot

949
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,679
so it's a bit like diane see that right

950
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,559
allows you to earn staking

951
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,320
rewards while yield farming in d5

952
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,559
chestlessly

953
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,360
and uh you can also say you know evm is

954
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,080
a module

955
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,799
on on our you know service modules so

956
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,960
we're fully

957
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,640
evm compatible you can build smart

958
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
contracts or any type of dap

959
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,320
on top of a color so basically you know

960
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,559
akala offers

961
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,559
d5 as a service um and then

962
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,240
yeah so uh and uh as we're demoing today

963
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,799
is probably the beginning of you will

964
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,840
see

965
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,080
uh composable services so that means uh

966
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
depths are composable with each other

967
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
that's a given

968
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,440
um but also smart contracts and depths

969
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,440
from other blockchains will be

970
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,919
composable with akala

971
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,720
and anyone you know who's be able to do

972
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
crushing

973
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,279
transactions together um so hopefully

974
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,200
you uh you'll get a taste of it today

975
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,320
and that's my introduction i'll hand

976
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,480
over to brian

977
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:15,360
now yeah sexpedit um so let me

978
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:16,960
share my screen

979
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,640
so you should be able to see my screen

980
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,320
now um yeah so

981
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,880
this is our um test net uh this is not

982
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,320
the mana test that we're running on yes

983
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,919
so this is where especially make

984
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,480
the power chain test net so it's

985
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,960
currently connecting to our version of

986
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,720
rococo so you can see um we have some

987
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,240
power change connecting to it

988
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,440
and just

989
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,399
yeah so so we can show some questions

990
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
demoing so let's get started um so first

991
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,799
thing

992
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,200
you probably want to do is what you want

993
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,519
you should have already some

994
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,559
uh variable ss there will be dots or

995
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,039
bitcoin

996
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,039
or maybe ethereum so for in this case

997
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,760
then you if you have already a bitcoin

998
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,440
you can use

999
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,279
procraftic to um uh using bitcoin to

1000
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,919
mean poca pdc and then using

1001
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,960
question transfer uh to transfer program

1002
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,080
dc into

1003
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,600
a color so obviously some um transfer

1004
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,880
fee will be applied

1005
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,960
and then once you've got some poker pdt

1006
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
uh okay there's a few things you can do

1007
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
with it so

1008
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,120
one thing of course you can do you sell

1009
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,200
it but that's well

1010
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,120
probably not the best idea so actually

1011
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
it does make some money without selling

1012
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,480
them so

1013
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
that's where the stable coin protocol

1014
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,720
comes handy

1015
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:38,000
so we can start a new

1016
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,720
loan so using the btc as the deporter um

1017
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,880
so let's say i can deposit my 0.2 pocket

1018
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,799
dc i will be able to borrow up to

1019
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,080
in this case 7000 so i can

1020
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,519
borrow all of it and then you'll see

1021
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,799
my liquidation price is this number

1022
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,120
and my current ratio is 120

1023
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,320
so this is um slightly on a dangerous

1024
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,760
size so

1025
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,080
maybe it's a good idea to borrow

1026
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,440
slightly less so i can pretty confident

1027
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,440
both

1028
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,639
it's unlikely bitcoin price will drop to

1029
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,679
30 000

1030
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,320
hopefully um yeah so this the

1031
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,679
next second just review there will be

1032
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,159
some interest rate charge on the

1033
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,839
borrowed

1034
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,359
amount uh that's my territory issue

1035
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,359
this i can make a transition

1036
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,960
yeah so this will make three thousand

1037
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,560
sorry 5000 akala usd

1038
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,560
from the poker pc i have deposited

1039
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,639
so now i have some money what can i do

1040
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,599
with it

1041
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,720
we have the swap so there's the dex

1042
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,320
which you can use

1043
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,520
to use the usd to buy other

1044
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,680
assets so you'll be able to buy also a

1045
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,400
question access as well

1046
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,040
including project pdc and box and run

1047
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,119
btc

1048
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,040
and few other assets in the future

1049
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,680
so in this case maybe i want to buy some

1050
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,400
dots which is obviously a good

1051
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,800
idea so i can spend

1052
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,119
1000 eosd which will buy this amount of

1053
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,119
dots

1054
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,520
um so once that's confirmed um when you

1055
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,800
have thoughts

1056
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,480
if you're not going to use it

1057
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,320
immediately it's probably a good idea to

1058
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,560
state them so you're earning the staking

1059
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,920
rewards reward

1060
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,839
which is have a reasonably good return

1061
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,240
so you can go to a portfolio to do the

1062
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,000
staking or another way is using a liquid

1063
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,880
stating protocol to do a staking which

1064
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,520
is

1065
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,359
much more easier so this is the express

1066
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,960
ui so you just enter the amount of dots

1067
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,800
you would like to take and

1068
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,880
click the stick button and that's

1069
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:02,079
all you need to do to stake dot and the

1070
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,880
protocol are decentralized and protocol

1071
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,200
will

1072
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,680
handle all the data selections

1073
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,200
nominations nominations etc

1074
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,359
but of course you can also vote for your

1075
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,240
favorite validators if you want to with

1076
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,359
your

1077
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,280
l dots so now i've changed all my dots

1078
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,480
to outdoors and

1079
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,040
uh then you'll be able to later and

1080
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
vote for the metadata if you want to um

1081
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,960
still

1082
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,960
working on the ui for this area

1083
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,240
so this is the mouse screen so

1084
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,240
you can see the history you can if you

1085
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,119
want to redeem you can

1086
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,960
you can so you can uh just wait for the

1087
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,440
whole unbounding period which will be

1088
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
um seven days okay summer 28 days on

1089
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,880
pokeball

1090
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,520
and then just wait and which we won't

1091
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,160
charge

1092
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,280
you an extra redeeming fee but if you

1093
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,839
really need the money right now

1094
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
up to the certain amounts then you will

1095
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,800
be able to redeem them

1096
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,720
immediately but we'll be charging you

1097
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,680
some of the reading fee because

1098
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,280
you're skipping the unbounded period but

1099
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,200
if you really need one

1100
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
rip near the dots right now this will be

1101
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,599
handy

1102
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,359
so now you have the outdoors and the you

1103
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,640
the staking rewards and how

1104
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,160
could you buy boots like increase

1105
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,800
the um the rates

1106
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,200
from the dots so another way to do that

1107
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,320
is

1108
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,440
uh for example you can do is

1109
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,440
add liquidity to our decks so there is

1110
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,920
basically lot certain amount of

1111
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,400
asd and lot your assets

1112
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,920
and then you will be supplying the

1113
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,960
liquidity to our decks

1114
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
and which will

1115
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,880
if people when people make trades you

1116
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,200
earn additional

1117
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,760
fees as rewards we also have a liquidity

1118
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,640
incentive program so you also at the

1119
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
same time

1120
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,200
in addition to the fees you have any

1121
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,400
additional usd

1122
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,400
as rewards as well

1123
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,200
so this is adding the liquidity to

1124
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,200
the decks and once and

1125
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,920
then a later stage if you want to you

1126
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,359
can also redeem the liquidity

1127
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,359
reading the token backs later

1128
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,599
um yes so the next thing i'll

1129
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,280
show you just a little quick this is

1130
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,520
still again working progress and we're

1131
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
still finalizing all the details and

1132
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
finalizing the ui but we have the

1133
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
governance feature

1134
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,079
so it will be somewhat similar to pogba

1135
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
or kusama but will be slightly more

1136
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,960
complicated

1137
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
we have the hometown council which will

1138
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,680
be one the one main engine for the

1139
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,160
stable point protocol

1140
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,320
for the hallmark console so i managed

1141
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,280
for the

1142
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
liquid staking vertical so as the elder

1143
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,320
holders

1144
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,760
you will be able to participate the

1145
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,200
homework console

1146
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,359
by using your ldl to vote for um

1147
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,359
as the sa holder holder you will be

1148
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,119
perfect able to participate the

1149
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,599
general counsel uh and the hong kong

1150
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,079
council governors

1151
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,800
so yes so those are still working for

1152
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,359
ways so it's

1153
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,640
not empty but hopefully at later stage

1154
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,079
we'll have much more thing

1155
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,079
in our test net to shoot

1156
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,880
so now um you have already

1157
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,000
having the thoughts making your profiles

1158
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,839
while you sleep what can i do with

1159
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
what else can i do so another thing you

1160
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,599
can do is

1161
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,040
you as i show you i generate a bunch of

1162
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,720
aoc

1163
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,839
from my poker pc and then next thing

1164
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,839
if i want to be

1165
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,839
increase my profit by taking some more

1166
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,520
risk i can transfer my

1167
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,800
akala usd to the laminar network

1168
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:02,000
so let's just transfer to some account

1169
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:05,280
so let's say how to transfer 2000 of it

1170
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,599
so let's do a question transfer

1171
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,400
from akala to the laminar so you can see

1172
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,680
the method is

1173
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,040
x token transfer to protein so this will

1174
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,880
transfer the money to

1175
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,440
the laminar technique so this will be

1176
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
making

1177
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,880
a question transfer and this will take a

1178
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,960
slightly bit more time so while this is

1179
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,920
transferring i'm going to quickly show

1180
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,480
you uh

1181
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
on the laminar side so assuming the

1182
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,920
transfer already

1183
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,480
says that i already got some asd and

1184
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,760
then i will be able to

1185
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,319
do a swipe so this dilemma will allow

1186
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,560
you to

1187
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,440
do the trading with sensitive assets so

1188
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,560
there will be

1189
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,040
like for example forex assets exchange

1190
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,040
or

1191
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,920
like other things like gold and oil etc

1192
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,119
so let's say i want to buy some euro

1193
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
maybe because

1194
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,319
well i'm going to travel to europe

1195
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,240
sometime

1196
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,720
europe sometimes so maybe i want to have

1197
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,880
some euro

1198
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,400
so so i can swap some aosd

1199
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,520
to the laminar euro

1200
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,200
and i also i also can do some margin

1201
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,640
trading so i can for example

1202
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,000
um leverage trade bitcoin or level trade

1203
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,200
ethereum or just do

1204
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,680
some my forex trading

1205
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,200
so i can deposit the money into the um

1206
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:33,040
the margin pool and then

1207
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,880
i can just say i can choose up to 20

1208
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,880
times leverage in this case so

1209
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,000
to decide to do a margin trading

1210
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,880
yeah so let's open the position i'll

1211
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,000
start getting the 20 times

1212
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,200
exposure on the usbjpy trading video

1213
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,520
uh this so with the question transfer

1214
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,040
show already success so

1215
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,440
let's check the events so you can see um

1216
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,079
yep so we have the question token

1217
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,280
transferred

1218
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,160
here so you can see this is sending

1219
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,599
a horizontal relay message so from a

1220
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,640
paragraph to project

1221
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,480
message uh relates through the

1222
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,119
religion which is the roku

1223
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,880
home fork of the roku in this case so on

1224
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,640
the laminar side you can see

1225
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,240
we have a deposit event

1226
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,040
should be this one so uh so 2000 asd is

1227
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,839
deposited into this account

1228
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,200
so this is basically um so the industry

1229
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,160
is basically

1230
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,640
the equestrian aoc transfer between that

1231
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,400
color

1232
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,520
and lamina yeah

1233
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
so that's all of the demo i'm going to

1234
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,480
show you

1235
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,480
so um just last but not least

1236
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,200
we are also working on the xcm

1237
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,160
functional token implementation so this

1238
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
will allow

1239
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,280
everything by including other

1240
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
powertrains to

1241
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,680
more easily just compose compose vote

1242
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,319
with each other

1243
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,400
so i've like well we have created open

1244
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,640
runner module library and created some

1245
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,839
of the question token transfer asset

1246
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,400
which is kind of used by

1247
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,280
quite a few project things including

1248
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,560
platinum

1249
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,119
vala and a few others

1250
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,480
um so to implement the question transfer

1251
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,760
so i'm also creating

1252
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,880
some implementation guides and um

1253
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,680
some implementation plans um to in the

1254
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,280
future to

1255
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,040
further help everyone to implement the

1256
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
question as a transfer

1257
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,319
so this will allow everyone to be able

1258
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,480
to compose

1259
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,599
with each other more easily just by

1260
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,040
integrating

1261
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,400
our library so that's all i have

1262
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,760
for you today um

1263
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,800
yeah so centrifuge is um

1264
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,680
bringing assets bringing

1265
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,839
real world assets to d5 so we allow

1266
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,079
businesses

1267
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:13,520
like uh real estate investors or

1268
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,800
um like a business that wants to finance

1269
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,040
their revenue to come

1270
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,480
and use defy as a source of liquidity

1271
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,000
instead of going to

1272
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,599
to a bank um so the most um

1273
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,520
the simplest way to describe it is we

1274
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,079
allow sort of all these different

1275
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,760
non-fungible real-world assets to be put

1276
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,119
into different kinds of pools so like

1277
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,839
say we have

1278
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,079
uh houses we our users can create a pool

1279
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,119
where then investors can invest we pull

1280
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,280
that money and then

1281
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,880
sort of different borrowers can borrow

1282
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,720
liquidity from that pool

1283
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,319
by depositing sort of a non-fungible

1284
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,440
token that represents

1285
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,040
an asset into that pool

1286
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,720
a bit about the history of centrifuge

1287
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,640
we've lost we've started sort of

1288
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,040
building in this like d5 ecosystem

1289
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
around

1290
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,560
three almost three years ago actually

1291
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,240
before d5 really was a thing and so from

1292
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,359
the very beginning we said okay how do

1293
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,040
we allow

1294
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,040
uh businesses that don't already or

1295
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,920
users that don't already have crypto to

1296
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,720
sort of interact

1297
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,359
in this system and so that's why we went

1298
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,800
with

1299
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,040
um sort of this idea of bringing

1300
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,560
new assets to d5 allowing new new

1301
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
liquidity allowing

1302
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,319
diversity uh different kinds of asset

1303
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,119
classes that you don't don't have today

1304
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,560
and so

1305
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,640
we actually launched on ethereum

1306
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,680
last year um sort of a product that we

1307
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,119
call tin lake

1308
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,839
which allows you to invest in

1309
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,319
in these different assets and i'll just

1310
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,839
give you

1311
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,760
a quick overview of what this looks like

1312
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,280
but we have what we call asset

1313
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,480
originators

1314
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,920
who who create these different pools we

1315
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,280
have for example as i mentioned real

1316
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,119
estate bridge loans

1317
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:52,800
so this is a pool of uh 1.6 million die

1318
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,319
uh with um about a five

1319
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,000
where i get a five percent interest rate

1320
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,839
if i invest in this pool

1321
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,319
and i can see sort of there's there's

1322
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,920
the

1323
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,680
five different loans ongoing at the

1324
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,200
moment they're paying different interest

1325
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,640
rates they have different maturity dates

1326
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,319
different amounts and i can see sort of

1327
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,680
all of this information is

1328
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,560
is on chain as actually i'm

1329
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,400
a bit of a tin lake power user myself

1330
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,520
and so on this wallet here that i'm

1331
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,200
using to demo

1332
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,640
um i have investments in these different

1333
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
tokens and all of these are earning an

1334
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,520
interest

1335
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,599
on um these different kinds of real

1336
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,599
world assets right and so i get this

1337
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,079
i get to use defy with assets that are

1338
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,800
completely uncorrelated extremely stable

1339
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,400
and give me this sort of um that all the

1340
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,960
advantages that thief i have with

1341
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,079
with the security the stability that um

1342
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,400
some of the

1343
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,359
safer asset classes have um coming back

1344
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,200
to the slides

1345
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,079
and sort of talking about why why we're

1346
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,079
talking about this at the

1347
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,280
um demo day um well sort of building and

1348
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,319
building all this we knew from very

1349
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,000
early on that like

1350
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,760
ethereum is not going to give us the

1351
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,760
scalability that we want

1352
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,520
but we also knew well we need to

1353
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,440
integrate we need to interface with all

1354
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,240
these other defect protocols and maker

1355
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
and ave are

1356
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,160
our projects we're actually working very

1357
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,680
closely with already

1358
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,599
and so so for that reason when we um

1359
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,960
when we think about centrifuges we've

1360
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,040
been for

1361
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,280
for a while now thinking that okay well

1362
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,000
we we don't exist in isolation we don't

1363
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,839
just exist on ethereum we really exist

1364
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
um to allow what we call our acid

1365
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,480
originators to bridge these acids to

1366
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,640
to wherever necessary right so and for

1367
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,440
example as collateral into akala

1368
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,800
uh putting it into a compound or a maker

1369
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,000
um and so

1370
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,520
sort of um what

1371
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
what is really important here right is

1372
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,880
this part here in the middle cross chain

1373
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,880
messaging in bridging

1374
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,000
and sort of to come back a bit about

1375
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,359
like where d5 has come from and like why

1376
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,559
ethereum has seen this um this insane

1377
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,839
amount of activity

1378
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,680
is actually i think it's one of the this

1379
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,200
the smartest things this ecosystem could

1380
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
have done is sort of standardize around

1381
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,040
this erc20 token

1382
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,559
we've created a standard that is

1383
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,839
extremely easy to use

1384
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,760
and that actually allows you to combine

1385
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,359
arbitrary protocols right a lending

1386
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,720
protocol with a money market with a

1387
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
decentralized exchange with an

1388
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,760
aggregator

1389
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,280
and then you can create wrap tokens and

1390
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,480
put them into liquidity pools and get

1391
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,720
more tokens and

1392
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,760
all of that is like around this very uh

1393
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,400
basic

1394
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,280
um standard it's not perfect but it

1395
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,760
works pretty

1396
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,200
pretty damn well i would say um so

1397
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,400
thinking about polka dot

1398
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,640
um well it's

1399
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,240
it's slightly more complicated right but

1400
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,680
in in the essence we still

1401
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,520
i think have the tools and it's a it's

1402
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,520
sort of in our

1403
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,640
um in our best interest and i want to

1404
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,119
talk about us

1405
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,800
i mean all of us we've been demoing here

1406
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,559
everyone who's building on polkadot

1407
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
to sort of think about how do we build

1408
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,480
this interoperability

1409
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,079
into polkadot as an ecosystem from the

1410
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,960
very start right so we don't have to

1411
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,440
have these

1412
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,640
thousands of different adapters and so

1413
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,720
um what's

1414
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,480
what miguel will talk about a bit about

1415
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,839
next is sort of we started this

1416
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,280
um we started another test net

1417
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,119
that we want to talk a bit and share

1418
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,720
about to help

1419
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,400
people that are building on people but

1420
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,640
already from a very early

1421
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,319
point in time to start thinking about

1422
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,200
integrating and i think it's great that

1423
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,400
akala for example

1424
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,240
showed how they used uh hoga btc

1425
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,079
as collateral to mint as some other

1426
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,240
stable point right so how do we

1427
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,559
build that and um so maybe i'll leave it

1428
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,440
to miguel to introduce cha-cha-cha on

1429
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,440
what we're doing with that

1430
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:45,839
thank you um let me share my screen now

1431
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,839
yeah here

1432
00:49:51,040 --> 00:50:00,960
all right um oops that's not the one

1433
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,960
right can you see my screen

1434
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,000
yep yep awesome thank you yeah so

1435
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,760
following a look at this presentation i

1436
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,640
think it's a good segue to introduce cha

1437
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,319
cha cha

1438
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,960
um so chad chai is a rococo based relay

1439
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,760
chain

1440
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,599
uh test net and when we were you know

1441
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,200
initially testing on our centrifuge

1442
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,000
chain how to convert our

1443
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,240
our chain to a para chain uh using

1444
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,520
cumulus we realized that there might be

1445
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,559
some other usefulness

1446
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,079
of sharing this uh this environment with

1447
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,119
with many other projects

1448
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,000
and uh so we did that so trajectory is a

1449
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,280
public

1450
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,839
test not based on on rococo

1451
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,480
so and the whole purpose is to to

1452
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,640
support

1453
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,760
the onboarding and the testing towards

1454
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,200
rococo by just

1455
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,880
on boarding a product chains earlier on

1456
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,000
you know figuring out the

1457
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,760
the issues um that they

1458
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,520
can come from there from their own run

1459
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,680
time or

1460
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,559
in addition to tests that will net fully

1461
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,920
networked

1462
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,880
uh deployments and importantly enough

1463
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,480
the interoperability with with other

1464
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,920
power chains like

1465
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,680
like lucas was uh was mentioning

1466
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:17,040
so um yeah

1467
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,680
so we a little bit of the you know the

1468
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,720
features

1469
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,720
that has uh is that

1470
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,760
it is a clone of rococo so it will

1471
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,000
always be

1472
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,680
at par with rococo codebase meaning

1473
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,760
um you know the tree of cumulus

1474
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,839
substrate polka dot repos

1475
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,359
that we wanted to keep always in at par

1476
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,680
with rococo so

1477
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,960
there's less surprises whenever your

1478
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,200
product chain is

1479
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,040
is included in or about to be included

1480
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,000
in in the regular contestant

1481
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,559
the idea is to have um frequent recycles

1482
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,400
so

1483
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,160
we will include many many product chains

1484
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,119
we will maybe make changes on

1485
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,760
on some of the runtime um to allow

1486
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,800
certain test cases to be to be verified

1487
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,240
but ideas that will cycle fast and it's

1488
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,040
immediate available available

1489
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,000
immediately

1490
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,040
so you can just follow the following

1491
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,760
instructions i will

1492
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,359
i will uh mention in a moment but

1493
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,920
there's no waiting list so as soon as

1494
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,559
you get in

1495
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,000
um and you send the proposal on the

1496
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,640
registration form

1497
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,800
then you will get in um so yeah the

1498
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,839
whole point as well is to try to

1499
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,520
to make emphasis more on this

1500
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:26,800
interoperability of barack chains so we

1501
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,200
try to set up the correct configuration

1502
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,480
for cross chain messaging palettes

1503
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,119
and try to support as much as possible

1504
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,240
this uh

1505
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:39,520
any project to to start moving messages

1506
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:43,599
assets tokens non-fungible fungible

1507
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,599
around us as soon as possible

1508
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,240
so if we uh look at briefly about the

1509
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,400
registration process

1510
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,079
is basically the same as rococo when you

1511
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,359
need to run a few validators

1512
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:58,640
one collater you have to fill up a form

1513
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:01,920
um which i can show you here it's same

1514
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,640
almost copy paste from rococo um just

1515
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,400
provide your

1516
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,319
you know element handle your account

1517
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,280
address so we can keep track of

1518
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,400
which account to send some funds um

1519
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,880
departure id

1520
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,880
so before um you know whenever we

1521
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,079
actually recycle or cycle the

1522
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,720
the uh the the chain then we

1523
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,400
can send funds uh towards your your

1524
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,000
account without having to

1525
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,599
uh for you to go through that process

1526
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,720
again

1527
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,680
um yeah please go to the chat channel in

1528
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,040
in element and uh and try to yeah just

1529
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,160
ask any questions you want uh for

1530
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,680
support i will

1531
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:41,520
we will help you to get that going and

1532
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:45,280
um of course everything right now is

1533
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,400
on the the wikipedia wiki as a

1534
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,520
as another uh source of uh you know

1535
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,079
documentation

1536
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,079
so feel free to follow these steps and

1537
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,760
we already onboarded a few

1538
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:00,800
parachutes and it was pretty painless

1539
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,680
um you can see i can show you

1540
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,040
the the ui at the moment that we have

1541
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,200
where we have a few product chains

1542
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,880
onboarded

1543
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:14,079
and then it's open for proposals so

1544
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,680
um yeah feel free to to follow these

1545
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,960
steps and start testing the interchange

1546
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,400
communication

1547
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,240
um yeah thank you hi everyone it's

1548
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,040
really exciting to be here and take part

1549
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,640
to part of this of this uh i think uh

1550
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,480
unique day right

1551
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,480
so hopefully you guys see my screen i

1552
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,520
think you do um

1553
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,119
all right so let's get to it so yeah

1554
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,799
my name is alberto i'm the developer

1555
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,760
relations manager at pure state which is

1556
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,760
the company

1557
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,880
building moonbeam the project that i'm

1558
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,839
going to talk to you

1559
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,200
about today so it's basically a smart

1560
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,960
contract protein with ethereum

1561
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,799
compatibility

1562
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,799
so the presentation will have a brief

1563
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,559
introduction uh of mubim

1564
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,839
and then we have a very special demo to

1565
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,960
show you guys and

1566
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,920
uh later on today i'll be joined by

1567
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,000
joe who is the cto of sushi swap and

1568
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,599
boring crypto which is uh the our lead

1569
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,200
architect of the bento box

1570
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,720
at sushi swap so very excited to have

1571
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,640
them on board as well

1572
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,760
so i guess the first question we have to

1573
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,799
ask ourselves it's

1574
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,920
what it's moonbeam and the most basic

1575
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,839
definition is that

1576
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,760
moonbeam is an ethereum compatible smart

1577
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,799
contract platform

1578
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,359
basically at its core it's uh it has an

1579
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,520
evm

1580
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,040
so this means that it it provides

1581
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,760
compatibility for solidity smart

1582
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,760
contracts

1583
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,520
or actually anything that compiles to to

1584
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,880
evm bytecode

1585
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,200
then we have different layers of

1586
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,520
functionalities on top of the evm

1587
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,559
the first one being a web 3 rpc as you

1588
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,040
can see here

1589
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,559
so this means that we're compatible with

1590
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,760
all the ethereum-based tools that you

1591
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,480
know and love already

1592
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,480
such as metamask truffle remix hard hat

1593
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,000
we have a bunch of documentation and

1594
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,839
have you can use these tools

1595
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,680
on moonbeam our test set for example

1596
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,160
mumbai safa today

1597
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,040
and also another great part of moonbeam

1598
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,480
is that we have

1599
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,480
basically uh we have worked around

1600
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,079
the we have modified the underlying

1601
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,480
account system of our

1602
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,319
para chain to standardize it where we

1603
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,240
standardize the account and key format

1604
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,000
to that of ethereum this is really

1605
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,599
exciting because it means that when you

1606
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,799
interact with our evm

1607
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,720
you're going to use your ethereum

1608
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,720
account and your ethereum private key as

1609
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,400
you would do right now on ethereum

1610
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,319
but then would you move to other like

1611
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,559
substrate based features or like parity

1612
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,319
in

1613
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,559
standard features like governance or

1614
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,520
staking which we just basically roll out

1615
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,839
to our tested

1616
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,720
a few weeks ago you're going to do all

1617
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,559
that as well

1618
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,240
with the same ethereum account and

1619
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,839
private key which is very exciting for

1620
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,680
us to share this with you

1621
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,680
and on top of all we have we have been

1622
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,640
building a great ecosystem of different

1623
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,880
integrations

1624
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,960
a lot of them are defy oriented but we

1625
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,319
have other great integrations as well

1626
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,640
and we're truly excited about the

1627
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,040
ecosystem we're building

1628
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,920
so why does a multi-chain strategy make

1629
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,599
sense and

1630
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,520
for the sake of this presentation i'm

1631
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,400
only going to talk about the topic in

1632
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,200
the middle

1633
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,359
and this is this is basically that new

1634
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,480
projects can be first movers in new

1635
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,960
markets right

1636
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,079
and a lot of these projects uh can can

1637
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,720
access

1638
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,160
through moonbeam to assets that are not

1639
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,480
native uh

1640
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,160
natively available on ethereum right so

1641
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,799
they can connect through moonbeam to

1642
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,799
either polkadot and kusama and accent

1643
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,720
access not only dot or ksm

1644
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,839
but a growing list of perichine-based

1645
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,200
assets

1646
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,119
and we think this is important because

1647
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,920
this provides just a new whole market

1648
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,440
that they can tap

1649
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,599
into and uh how does moonbeam

1650
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,480
plays out in this multi-chain uh world

1651
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,839
right so

1652
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,760
basically let's say that you have your

1653
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,119
solidity-based smart contracts and you

1654
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,079
can either have them deployed to

1655
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,079
ethereum

1656
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,920
and then just let's say that you're

1657
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,760
using this this uh very common tool

1658
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,400
called truffle or let's say hard hat or

1659
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,559
whatever

1660
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,240
and you have uh truffle or hard hat set

1661
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,880
up to deploy these contracts to a theme

1662
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,960
right

1663
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,440
and just by changing or adding the

1664
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,160
provider of mumbai's alpha or tesla for

1665
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,480
example

1666
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,839
you can display those contracts exactly

1667
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,960
the same without with minor

1668
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:01,280
modifications if

1669
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,559
if if if needed because it sometimes

1670
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,680
then you don't have to do any

1671
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,160
modifications

1672
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,920
to moonbeam and and we have had a lot of

1673
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,119
feedback from projects saying that it's

1674
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,680
just unbelievably

1675
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,480
simple to do so and this means that if

1676
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,240
you do so

1677
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,160
you you'll your contracts will leave a

1678
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,480
moonbeam but more importantly you'll

1679
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,799
have

1680
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,240
access to the whole polkadot ecosystem

1681
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,720
of other pair of chains

1682
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,680
so which is just basically great to do

1683
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,359
so right

1684
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,040
and some of the projects that are

1685
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,440
working on moonbeam include

1686
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,960
uh for example sushi swap yesterday we

1687
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,040
announced that bouncer is coming to

1688
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,880
mumbing which is very exciting for us

1689
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,839
we also have ocean protocol human

1690
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,200
protocol idx and a ton of other projects

1691
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,960
so we're really excited about the

1692
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,960
ecosystem that we're building

1693
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,000
and it's just truly amazing to see the

1694
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,040
progress that we've made

1695
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,960
made over the past weeks

1696
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,119
and i think the most exciting part for

1697
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,640
me today about this presentation is to

1698
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,119
show you guys the balance your demo that

1699
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,079
we've

1700
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,400
prepared so basically uh as you've heard

1701
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,160
me

1702
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,160
say before a balancer is coming to

1703
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,200
moonbeam and we wrote a blog post about

1704
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,000
it you can see it

1705
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,280
on this link on the in the slide and uh

1706
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,599
what i'm gonna show you today

1707
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,440
is a demo a demo proof of concept so

1708
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,240
basically uh we really worked hard on

1709
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,160
providing

1710
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,599
uh on bringing all the smart contracts

1711
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,599
from balancer to moonbeam

1712
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,079
making sure to adapt their front end so

1713
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,000
we had some some help with parity uh

1714
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,839
and some cases but it was truly amazing

1715
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,400
to see you know bring in the bouncer

1716
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,359
to to moonbeam so we have a very uh a

1717
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,880
proof of concept

1718
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,799
demo that will show the core

1719
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,160
functionalities uh also including the

1720
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,319
smart order routing

1721
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,440
uh which is basically the the tool that

1722
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,440
it's used to to

1723
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,880
maximize or get you the best price

1724
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,760
possible when you're doing trade sub

1725
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,920
tokens

1726
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,119
uh if you have time we'll i'll show you

1727
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,960
the pool management

1728
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,960
ui which is uh something related to

1729
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,160
you can create pools and and do other

1730
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,680
stuff and

1731
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,319
we're also looking for a long-term

1732
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,319
support uh meaning that uh

1733
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,559
we're looking for developers or teams

1734
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,880
that maintain balancer on moonbeam

1735
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,000
uh this means that there are grants that

1736
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,760
are being issued both

1737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,760
by balancer and moonbeam and you can

1738
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,240
find more information in the link that

1739
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,599
it's uh

1740
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,920
it's uh basically on the on the slide

1741
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,920
so yeah uh for this demo uh what i want

1742
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,520
to do now it's it's basically to explain

1743
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,760
you a little bit of the uh

1744
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,640
of the pools that we've deployed uh to

1745
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,280
moonbeam

1746
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,040
so uh basically we have deployed uh we

1747
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,160
don't have the graph fully working right

1748
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,240
now on our test net

1749
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,680
although we're actually trying to to

1750
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,079
bring this this feature set

1751
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,079
to to moonbase alpha soon so we have to

1752
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,640
plot we have actually

1753
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,000
we've actually um deployed some students

1754
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,760
some amount of pools

1755
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,280
with some token allocations and the

1756
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,680
pools already uh

1757
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,319
right so let's just say for example pool

1758
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,040
one

1759
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,160
so in the case of pool 1 we have a 33

1760
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,480
distribution weight

1761
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,319
and we have actually said for example uh

1762
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,880
rap 8 we have deposited 100

1763
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,319
rap each 200 token ones so these are

1764
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,760
erc20 tokens

1765
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:57,040
and 300 uh token twos in pool 2 what

1766
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,400
we've done is

1767
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,880
do a 25 distribution in weight and we've

1768
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,400
actually

1769
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:08,319
uh done uh 100 wrap each 200 300

1770
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,720
and 400 and on uh and we have other

1771
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,920
pools

1772
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,079
i'm not going to go through like the

1773
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,760
math or anything but the idea is that we

1774
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,520
have pre-deployed a certain amount of

1775
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,720
pools with tokens allocated so we can

1776
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,640
trade with them right

1777
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,319
and don't go into the math here because

1778
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,000
you can probably arbitrage

1779
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,319
the crap out of these pools but it's

1780
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,839
just for demo purposes

1781
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:30,079
so i'm going to go ahead and

1782
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,119
jump to the demo that i prepared for you

1783
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,599
guys so

1784
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,359
this is basically the balancer front one

1785
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,599
one of the balancers front and

1786
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,680
that you can see here i have connected

1787
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,520
it to a moonbeam node

1788
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,319
and you can see that i have metamask

1789
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,720
being used as an injected provider here

1790
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,599
and what i have here is an account that

1791
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,079
holds

1792
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,680
different amount of tokens and i'm gonna

1793
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,400
for example show you guys

1794
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,319
what happens when i do a trade between

1795
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,720
rap eath and token 2

1796
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,640
so if i just put here two tokens you

1797
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,680
will see that i get the price

1798
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,400
information and if i expand this menu

1799
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,319
right here

1800
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,920
you can see that the smart order routing

1801
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,319
is optimizing my trade

1802
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,240
by using two balancer pools so this is

1803
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:15,440
really great to see here

1804
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,880
um if i for example choose to trade

1805
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,280
rap eth versus token three i'm gonna put

1806
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,680
here

1807
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,680
five you will see that once again the

1808
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,640
smart order routing that actually works

1809
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,480
off chain

1810
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,760
is optimizing my trade with these two

1811
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,319
balancer pools

1812
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,280
but if i increase this uh this right

1813
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,520
here

1814
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,319
you will see that now the smart aura

1815
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,160
routing is

1816
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:38,319
including another pull into the party

1817
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,319
right so it's great to see how this you

1818
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,079
know this trade is being optimized to to

1819
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,200
give you the user the best price

1820
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,520
possible

1821
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,359
and now what i can do is it's go ahead

1822
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,160
and let's let's do this swap right so i

1823
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,440
have

1824
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,079
500 right wrap ease and 300 uh token

1825
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,880
threes

1826
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,359
and i'm going to go ahead and click swap

1827
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,000
so

1828
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,960
as you would expect in in in ethereum

1829
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,880
metamask will pop

1830
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,160
up saying that you know you want to sign

1831
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,920
this transaction

1832
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,359
and you can see that i have a grasp gas

1833
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,720
price set to zero and this is because

1834
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:09,920
this is tested

1835
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:12,480
and i can just click confirm and the

1836
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,280
trade is being done you can see here the

1837
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,440
spinning loading interface and you can

1838
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,720
see now that i have

1839
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,880
450 rap eth and i have 150 more

1840
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,640
token threes and the cool thing is now

1841
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,839
the smart order router is actually

1842
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,160
telling me now that the

1843
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,880
the pool the trade if you do this trade

1844
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,280
again

1845
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,119
the the the pool allocation will be

1846
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,640
different for to maximize and optimize

1847
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,000
this this trade

1848
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,839
so i think this is really cool and

1849
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,400
really uh amazing to show you guys

1850
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,559
balancer working on moonbeam

1851
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,880
another ui that i prepared for you guys

1852
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,720
is this pool management ui

1853
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,400
so right now like i mentioned we don't

1854
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,960
have the graph working

1855
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,520
on on moonbase alpha but hopefully in

1856
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,520
the next

1857
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,119
weeks we'll have an instance of balance

1858
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,760
or sub graphs working

1859
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,039
because this information is fed by the

1860
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,640
balancer subgraph

1861
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,240
so i mean this information that you see

1862
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,200
right here is currently on ethereum

1863
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,520
mainnet

1864
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,559
but other functionalities of this of

1865
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,480
this web ui

1866
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,000
actually works you can wrap some for

1867
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,400
example eve

1868
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,200
i can just i have actually i have i have

1869
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,319
450 so before i do this

1870
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:21,039
let me reload this page

1871
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,680
so you can see that i have 450 wrap each

1872
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,799
i'm gonna

1873
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,640
deposit 50 each for example

1874
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,720
and one this this once this trade is

1875
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,640
confirmed and this page will reload the

1876
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,280
balance you should see that i have

1877
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,880
i'll have 500 e wrap each down here

1878
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,880
hopefully it reloads in time

1879
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,359
if not i'll just reload this way web

1880
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,480
page

1881
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:48,640
there you go i have uh 500 rapies now

1882
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,400
i can also create a pool to create a

1883
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,000
pool i first have to set up a proxy if

1884
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,240
you're familiar with balancer

1885
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,200
so i'll just go ahead and set up my

1886
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,200
proxy contract

1887
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,920
and so once the proxy contract is set up

1888
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,680
so the proxy contract is how you

1889
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,680
interact with the balancer pools

1890
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,599
so i can click next and just add the

1891
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,920
amount of tokens that i want to add to

1892
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,960
my pool right so i can add for example

1893
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,039
uh let's put fifty percent in in uh wrap

1894
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,400
each and i'll put 100 in amount

1895
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,000
25 percent token one i'm not really sure

1896
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,079
about the amounts i should set but

1897
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,039
this is just for demo purposes right

1898
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,039
oops

1899
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,359
and then basically if i approve the

1900
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,160
proxy as an expender in this erc 20

1901
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,119
tokens

1902
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,240
i'll just set up a swap 3 for example

1903
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,640
and i can just

1904
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,400
click this warning message and just

1905
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,119
create i cannot do it right now because

1906
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,480
i have to

1907
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:41,039
you know approve the proxy as an

1908
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,640
expander but for the purpose of the demo

1909
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,039
we wanted to show you guys this proof of

1910
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,960
concept and like i mentioned before uh

1911
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,559
we're working we're looking for teams to

1912
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,280

1913
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,200
long term and and and support this

and show you kind of like first of all

1943
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,599
um we we deployed to moon beams test at

1944
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,799
moon base

1945
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,799
um and we're

1946
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,680
from the standpoint that um

1947
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,680
uh

1948
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,359
moonbeam came to us it was out of time

1949
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,839
hey do you mind going on uh thank you

1950
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:30,400
cool uh it came to us a time when

1951
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:32,880
um uh sushi was

1952
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,640
you know kind of like in a downturn um

1953
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,720
nobody wanted to work with us and

1954
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,880
uh moonbeam was a team that reached out

1955
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,880
to

1956
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,079
a make a sushi deployment on moonbeam

1957
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:52,559
so like uh moonbeam is kind of a

1958
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,559
project that's you know close to us

1959
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,119
we have already deployed to moonbase and

1960
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,880
um and we're going to do a swap and add

1961
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,880
and then remove

1962
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:12,480
uh just like anything else um

1963
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,970
uh we're going to uh swap

1964
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,220
uh we're

1965
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,220
[Music]

1966
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:25,839
confirm and

1967
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,239
you know there's always like that kind

1968
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,120
of like that that time in between from

1969
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,120
when you get swapped

1970
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,839
clearing

1971
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:07,839
all right there we go swapped

1972
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:07,839
uh yeah

1973
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:18,839
[Music]

1974
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:21,839
it's choppy uh

1975
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,839
okay

1976
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,839

1977
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,920
well so i don't know if it's we broke

1978
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:37,520
crowdcast like we did on the encoded

1979
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,520
presentation or what's going on but

1980
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,719

okay yeah uh is my is my audio working

1982
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,880
out

1983
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:00,840
it's still a little choppy

1984
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,080
maybe maybe i turn my video off is it

1985
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,960
better

1986
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,920
i think that's better okay cool just let

1987
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,520
me know if it

1988
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,280
like interrupt me if it starts uh

1989
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,320
becoming a problem

1990
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,719
yeah video frozen yeah okay cool cool

1991
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,239
yeah it must be like my downlink or

1992
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,320
whatever yeah um

1993
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:20,400
did uh what did we miss did we miss the

1994
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,280
swap

1995
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,400
the whole demo oh the whole demo worked

1996
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,360
great okay cool

1997
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,400
so all right so now we're networking yo

1998
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,080
you can't see your screen

1999
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,800
okay cool this is

2000
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,880
i swear i tested this before i started

2001
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,520
um

2002
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,520
that's just boring okay uh

2003
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:51,520
not really any controls here for the

2004
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,320
screen sharing anymore if you hover over

2005
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:58,159
here

2006
01:10:52,320 --> 01:11:00,239
i see i see yeah sorry

2007
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:03,040
okay cool can we see the screens now

2008
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,040
there you go yep

2009
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,199
right we were able to see the swapper

2010
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,840
nope

2011
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:29,440
um we'll do a max here

2012
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,440
and and we'll supply that

2013
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:35,920
the um the uh

2014
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,600
we're adding these two token pairs into

2015
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,960
a liquidity pool and this is part of the

2016
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,360
amm design

2017
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,040
right um an amm design is basically a

2018
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,280
forced buyer seller

2019
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,960
um to provide liquidity for the market

2020
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,679
hence liquidity provider

2021
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,840
um or lp tokens right so we're minting

2022
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:55,679
lp tokens by being both sides of the

2023
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:58,880
trade oh

2024
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:02,080
dang this stinks all right cool

2025
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,040
um so anyway so there we go it's

2026
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,159
confirmed

2027
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,640
uh we have added the liquidity it's now

2028
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:10,800
in

2029
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:14,080
in the pool um and we'll do a remove

2030
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:18,080
let's do a remove we gotta

2031
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:21,120
uh do an approve ah very nice

2032
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:24,239
we did a we implemented approves yeah

2033
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,239
okay cool there we go

2034
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:37,230
um and uh wait for that to

2035
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:40,300
go through and then we're done

2036
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:40,300
[Music]

2037
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:06,080
i was told that there would be a bit of

2038
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:08,320
lag on the test net today

2039
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,760
and i think that that is really good

2040
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,760
feedback because it definitely is

2041
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,199
there we go mine great okay cool so yeah

2042
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,280
that's the demo

2043
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,520
we're able to swap add remove liquidity

2044
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,600
we're already deployed on moonbeam so

2045
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,760
create your test tokens and like

2046
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,199
integrate um in the way that you think

2047
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,880
that you'll integrate when we go to

2048
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:32,320
mainnet because we're going to mainnet

2049
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,120
as well um

2050
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,120
and we have like a pretty good i think

2051
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,600
um

2052
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,199
plan for you know the mainnet launch

2053
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:47,440
can't wait for you guys to see it

2054
01:13:41,199 --> 01:14:01,840
all right

2055
01:13:47,440 --> 01:14:01,840
cool uh let me figure this out

2056
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:46,640
sorry about that

2057
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,840
all right um so i'm going to talk about

2058
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,040
the bento box today

2059
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,560
um that we deployed on uh moonbeam um

2060
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,679
deployment was very easy

2061
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,440
um just with hardhead like any evm

2062
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,600
compatible chain we had no problems with

2063
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:03,840
that which is very nice

2064
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:06,400
um so the bento box is basically um

2065
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,159
it's kind of like a token fault and you

2066
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,960
can just load your tokens into it so

2067
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,280
here

2068
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:15,199
you can see i have some token balances

2069
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,480
and i also have some tokens in the bento

2070
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:19,520
box and

2071
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,159
this kind of shows um whether i i have a

2072
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,480
proof this or not so

2073
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:26,080
here you can if you open this up you can

2074
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,679
see this hasn't been approved yet

2075
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:32,640
um so if i want i can approve this all

2076
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,600
and after that i can move tokens um i've

2077
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,199
already put some

2078
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,880
some sushi tokens in here um

2079
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,400
so they're they're sitting in my bento

2080
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,320
box now

2081
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,360
and um so the bento box is a token fold

2082
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,360
that

2083
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,719
many people can build protocols on top

2084
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,360
of so

2085
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,800
um kashi the lending platform will be

2086
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,120
one of the first things that

2087
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,239
we will deploy on it but for the demo

2088
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,960
today

2089
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,760
i've got a sort of a simpler example of

2090
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,040
a

2091
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:06,239
salaries less fasting

2092
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,880
feed that you can create so we'll go

2093
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:11,120
ahead and do that

2094
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,120
so

2095
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,320
let's say in the next 30 minutes we're

2096
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,320
gonna fast

2097
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:23,360
some sushi thousands we see

2098
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,360
and we're going to create this

2099
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,840
okay i guess we're not going to create

2100
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,840
it

2101
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,400
anyway i already created some some

2102
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,560
salaries here that you can see

2103
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:49,840
maybe just to refresh the page there we

2104
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,840
go that's why

2105
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:03,840
all right let's do that again

2106
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,600
and

2107
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,719
so that should um create a new new

2108
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,239
salary

2109
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:24,320
and it's using the funds from the bento

2110
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:27,440
box so it will use the funds from here

2111
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,840
and so obviously

2112
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,040
why would you use another wallet or

2113
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:35,199
token fold

2114
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:37,120
and the reason is yields so

2115
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:39,760
the whole point of d5 you know we don't

2116
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,840
want better yields

2117
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,280
and so what the bento box does is any

2118
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,719
tokens that are sitting in there that

2119
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,920
are idle

2120
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,880
can create yields in the background so

2121
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,120
if we

2122
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,640
have a look here we will see that

2123
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:56,960
there's actually

2124
01:17:52,640 --> 01:18:01,120
a strategy attached to this this token

2125
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:05,040
so 88 of these tokens are automatically

2126
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:07,120
invested into

2127
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:10,000
a strategy that creates yield in this

2128
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:14,400
case it's using the

2129
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:18,000
sushi bar and for that for

2130
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:20,640
to show this for demo purposes

2131
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,640
i have

2132
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,280
created so this is the bar there is some

2133
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,880
stuff sitting in there

2134
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:32,719
and what we can do is we can

2135
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,719
just donate some money into that

2136
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:38,480
so normally this would be through actual

2137
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:41,920
profit from the from the system

2138
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,920
but that part is not running out

2139
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,239
just wait till that comes in

2140
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,159
and here we see our salary that's been

2141
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,159
that's that's uh has been created

2142
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,800
and so what you can see here this is now

2143
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,520
a thousand sushi that i've just looked

2144
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,600
up

2145
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,880
um that's gonna be fasting in the next

2146
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:12,000
30 minutes

2147
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:14,640
so normally that would just be dead

2148
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,080
tokens that are not not working same as

2149
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,880
in the banter box here i have

2150
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,120
98 000 sitting there it's not doing

2151
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,440
anything

2152
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,880
but now you can see if i actually

2153
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,600
harvest

2154
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,600
the strategy

2155
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,960
then the benefits from the strategy will

2156
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,159
be applied to

2157
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,159
any protocol any tokens that have a

2158
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:45,440
strategy in any protocol built on top of

2159
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,440
that will benefit from that

2160
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:51,840
just wait till that goes through

2161
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,239
and here we can see we've got now more

2162
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,600
sushi that is that is sitting there

2163
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:06,719
fasting

2164
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:10,320
and our balance here has gone up as well

2165
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:12,000
so even while your tokens are

2166
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,440
doing something let's say they're eating

2167
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,760
sitting in an amm

2168
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,080
or sitting in a landing platform if it's

2169
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,159
built on top of the bento box

2170
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,960
you're getting extra yields both through

2171
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:25,280
flash loans and through strategies

2172
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,920
and this is all running live on on the

2173
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:33,840
modern beam test net right now

2174
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,840
cool well that's it for me

2175
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:41,440
okay uh so that is the demo

2176
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,280
welcome back to another mining chamber

2177
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,360
video in this video i'm going to show

2178
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,560
you how to effectively use your main pc

2179
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,320
sorry

2180
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:53,520
it's also playing all right so uh

2181
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,639
that is the demo and uh

2182
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,199
actually we call we call the project as

2183
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,880
a confidential confidentiality layer for

2184
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:04,239
polka dot ecosystem

2185
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,639
and unlike other uh blockchains we serve

2186
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,520
as an

2187
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,239
infrastructure in the uh powertrain

2188
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,360
ecosystem

2189
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:14,560
instead of like instead of

2190
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,280
being a standalone platform to run

2191
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,719
something

2192
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:21,760
we intend to serve other blockchains

2193
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:24,719
so uh i

2194
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,840
just also introduced uh myself a little

2195
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,239
bit i'm hung

2196
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,880
uh and i'm from fellow network i'm the

2197
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:32,239
co-founder

2198
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,239
and lead developer so

2199
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:37,040
uh what is the so why we call it

2200
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:39,920
confidentiality layer

2201
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,320
uh so if you are if you are familiar

2202
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,280
with

2203
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,760
the smart contract and blockchain you

2204
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,239
know that

2205
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,280
everything on blockchain is actually

2206
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,520
transparent

2207
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,719
because this is how blockchain work we

2208
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,520
need consensus

2209
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:55,120
we need to replica of the data over the

2210
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,840
network to make sure

2211
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,280
the data can be trusted can be trusted

2212
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,520
and verified

2213
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,199
and this creates a problem because

2214
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,159
everything on the blockchain is

2215
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:07,199
transparent

2216
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:10,239
so if you want to store something secret

2217
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,880
and you want to store some user privacy

2218
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,760
data

2219
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,880
it will become a problem for us so

2220
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,520
instead of

2221
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,400
running the smart contract right on the

2222
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,639
blockchain

2223
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,480
we use a technology called trusted

2224
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,600
execution environment

2225
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:28,080
so it's an insulated area in the cpu

2226
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,840
so actually it's also called hardware

2227
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,600
secure enclave because it's a

2228
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,520
combination of hardware

2229
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,320
and software so uh we can deploy some

2230
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,600
program

2231
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,960
in the te in the enclave so

2232
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,520
uh because it's isolated from the other

2233
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,000
parts

2234
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,960
in the system so even if you have the

2235
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,440
control over

2236
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,880
the operating system or you even have

2237
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,520
the physical access

2238
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,040
to the computer you still cannot

2239
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,400
manipulate the data

2240
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:01,280
inside you cannot access the data

2241
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,800
inside the enclave and of course the ram

2242
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,639
is also encrypted

2243
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:09,840
so it's end-to-end encrypted

2244
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:12,880
so what about we run the smart contract

2245
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,320
in the enclave so for example if we put

2246
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,280
a token contract

2247
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,560
into the secure enclave it turns into a

2248
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:22,159
privacy token

2249
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,360
so you you can send some token to others

2250
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:27,520
but you cannot be besides

2251
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,639
uh the the sender and the receiver

2252
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,600
nobody else

2253
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,480
can see the amount the sender and the

2254
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,920
receiver

2255
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,880
of the the transaction of course we can

2256
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,080
also like put some

2257
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,800
nft inside the secure enclave so we can

2258
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,080
make like

2259
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,880
loot box and if we put the unislab

2260
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,400
uh contract inside the enclave we can

2261
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,600
make it a dark pool

2262
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,639
and also like we can also use the

2263
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,280
secure enclave to protect the position

2264
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,920
for some derivatives like some lending

2265
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,199
protocol

2266
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:03,840
or option protocol so

2267
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,800
how we make it uh how do we make it

2268
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,679
happen

2269
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,520
so uh what we what we have is something

2270
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:12,800
called confidential contract it's

2271
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:15,199
very similar to a regular smart contract

2272
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,000
as and as you can see here we have a

2273
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:19,840
very simple

2274
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,120
demo uh this is a hello world contract

2275
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:26,400
it only have a counter and we have a

2276
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,800
commands which is just like transactions

2277
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,480
you send transaction to the blockchain

2278
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,320
to invoke the command

2279
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:37,600
and in this uh in this

2280
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,440
sample it supports increment the counter

2281
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,920
by some amount

2282
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,120
so far is very similar to regular

2283
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,239
contract

2284
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:49,360
but uh what is uh different

2285
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:51,600
is that the the intermediate state the

2286
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,080
input the output is all

2287
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,679
encrypted so in order to query the

2288
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,440
contract you cannot just

2289
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,040
pull the data from the blockchain

2290
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,320
because it's encrypted

2291
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:05,040
so instead of uh instead of that

2292
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,920
what we should do is to define the query

2293
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,400
acquirer is

2294
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,840
very similar to when you like you are

2295
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,120
building a backhand

2296
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,400
and you accept some requests from the

2297
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:18,159
clients right

2298
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:21,520
so uh inside the query you can actually

2299
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:24,639
check the credential of the requesters

2300
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,760
uh for example in this uh sample

2301
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,159
uh the first line of the contract we

2302
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,719
check

2303
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,159
if the sender is the root account so if

2304
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,440
it's not a root account

2305
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:38,960
we can return an arrow not authorized

2306
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:42,000
and if you are root account then we can

2307
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,800
reply with with the actual account

2308
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,360
read from the contract so in this way

2309
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,000
actually we protect the privacy and

2310
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,880
we can we make it very flexible for the

2311
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,440
developers

2312
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,239
to define which data can be accessed

2313
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,639
outside

2314
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,679
the smart contract and which data is

2315
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,320
protected

2316
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:01,280
inside the confidential smart contract

2317
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,679
of course

2318
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,960
one thing to mention is that now this is

2319
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:07,199
showing our native

2320
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,639
rust contract and in the future we are

2321
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:12,480
going to switch to

2322
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:15,199
inc smart contract very soon

2323
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,920
uh so that is one part is the smart

2324
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,600
contract

2325
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:21,120
but how do we provide the

2326
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:24,719
confidentiality to other projects

2327
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:28,000
so the way is used by using xcmp

2328
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,719
so like is showing in this uh diagram

2329
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,159
on file network we can have multiple

2330
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,239
secure enclaves

2331
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,199
running the smart contract and they are

2332
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,920
heterogeneous

2333
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,880
actually so we we don't deploy all the

2334
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:42,239
contracts

2335
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:45,520
on uh on all the secure enclaves

2336
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:46,000
but instead we can deploy uh like if we

2337
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,520
have

2338
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,400
100 uh secure enclave so in theory we

2339
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,679
can we can

2340
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,639
we can run 100 smart contracts at the

2341
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,040
same time

2342
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,000
and in this way we can have a very high

2343
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,400
throughput

2344
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,199
but it also creates a problem that is

2345
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,480
how this

2346
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:06,960
smart contract can communicate

2347
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,080
with each other so the answer is using

2348
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,120
xcmp

2349
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,679
so from the beginning we have this

2350
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,040
we we have the compat uh compatibility

2351
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:18,080
with xcmp

2352
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:20,960
in our mind when we started the project

2353
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,080
so all the way to interact with the

2354
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,120
smart contract

2355
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:28,320
is through xampp so of course

2356
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:30,320
uh we can let other smart contracts on

2357
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,400
other blockchains to invoke the

2358
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,560
confidential smart contract on phala

2359
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:37,760
network

2360
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,239
so like here is the first uh uh here

2361
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,120
it is a deep dive of the of the demo we

2362
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:44,480
just show

2363
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:47,199
in this uh in this presentation

2364
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,800
which is secret assets we also call it

2365
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:52,080
called secret wallets

2366
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,960
so in secret wallet so any part chain

2367
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,080
can send their

2368
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:59,360
token to our blockchain and we

2369
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:02,320
uh we will uh save the balance

2370
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,960
in inside the secure enclave so in this

2371
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,600
way

2372
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,560
all the trans as long as you convert

2373
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,120
some token

2374
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,080
from other blockchains to our secret

2375
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,199
wallet

2376
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:15,600
and then you cannot order like all the

2377
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,480
transferring all the transactions is

2378
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,080
invisible

2379
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:23,199
from the blockchain and

2380
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:27,040
uh under the hood uh so here we

2381
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:29,679
uh we we are showing uh what happened

2382
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,480
under the hood so like in the demo we

2383
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,360
showed that

2384
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,239
we can send some a color token to file

2385
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,199
our network

2386
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:38,320
secret secret wallet so the first thing

2387
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:41,199
is to invoke

2388
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,000
the transfer function on the akala side

2389
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:44,320
and here we

2390
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,440
show that this is actually actually an

2391
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,800
xcm

2392
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:52,080
uh an xcm sent to a power channel 13

2393
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:55,600
which is file network so actually xcm

2394
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:58,880
has two parts one parse uh the first

2395
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:02,880
part is the message itself it defines

2396
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:05,760
uh how the message will uh

2397
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,880
so what what the message is is

2398
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,159
describing

2399
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:12,159
and uh the second part is the effects it

2400
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:15,520
describes what we'll do

2401
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:18,159
when we receive this message so uh when

2402
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,960
we transfer some token from a color

2403
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:21,679
uh the the message we created is called

2404
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,800
withdraw

2405
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:26,239
assets because you will first withdraw

2406
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,520
some token from your

2407
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:31,040
own account and deposit it into the

2408
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,520
reserved account

2409
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:35,040
uh which is the uh which is controlled

2410
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,400
by file network

2411
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:41,840
and then after the deposit is

2412
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,480
already there we can also uh

2413
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,120
in we can also trigger more effects

2414
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,960
happening

2415
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:51,199
on the other blockchains so uh

2416
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,520
when the transfer is done on the color

2417
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:57,040
side there will be a hrmp

2418
01:29:53,520 --> 01:30:01,120
message uh from a color to local

2419
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:04,080
and uh by uh and and through xcm

2420
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,560
executor on the local side uh it will

2421
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,760
also

2422
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,560
it will uh redirect the the message from

2423
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,920
local code

2424
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,800
to file a network so this parts

2425
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:16,159
an upstream upward message and a

2426
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,719
downward message

2427
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,360
combined together is called is the

2428
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:23,760
regular

2429
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:26,639
hrmp but uh unlike other blockchains

2430
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,280
we don't want to build everything on our

2431
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:31,520
blockchain but instead we want to

2432
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,960
uh we want to serve the other

2433
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,920
blockchains

2434
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,480
by using our confidential smart contract

2435
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,000
so

2436
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:43,280
the end point is actually not the uh

2437
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,239
not valid network the blockchain but

2438
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:48,960
the confidential smart contract so on

2439
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:52,159
fire network what we have is not the

2440
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:56,239
end point but an xcm rotor

2441
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:59,600
the rotor will redirect the message

2442
01:30:56,239 --> 01:31:02,880
received from other power chains and

2443
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,239
dispatch it to the actual secure enclave

2444
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,199
who ran the

2445
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:08,159
secret wallet so we call this an ingress

2446
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,040
message

2447
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:11,920
and the actual endpoint is contract

2448
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,040
assets

2449
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,239
uh and this is the this is not the uh

2450
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:21,600
the the the assets pallets uh on

2451
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:24,320
uh substrate side this is the

2452
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,560
this is the the confidential version

2453
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:29,600
inside the te enclave

2454
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,320
yeah so what we received is a message

2455
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:36,320
called deposit assets

2456
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:40,080
and the xcm comes from project 666

2457
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:44,639
which is a color and the destination

2458
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:48,000
is uh is an account a in the

2459
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:51,520
in in the file network uh

2460
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,560
space so uh actually when you send some

2461
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,120
token from

2462
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,000
uh one person to another project you can

2463
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,560
specify

2464
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,600
you can send send the token from your

2465
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,159
own account

2466
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,920
to uh also your own account but on

2467
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,679
another blockchain but you can also

2468
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,800
specify some other accounts

2469
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:12,080
for sure and

2470
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,679
uh we call this off chain hrm

2471
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,480
just just to let you know we've only got

2472
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:19,840
about a minute or two for this section

2473
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:22,960
okay okay i will be very quick so yeah

2474
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:26,000
so uh this is the uh this is uh we call

2475
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:29,440
this off-chain hrmp

2476
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,040
and of course uh the the the in the

2477
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:35,520
uh reversed direction we can also

2478
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,520
send an egress message to withdraw some

2479
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,040
token from our side and

2480
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:44,800
pass it directly to the akala site to

2481
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:46,239
send the token back yeah so we were

2482
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,920
going to launch the

2483
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:52,960
uh the secret network on local kobe 1

2484
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:56,159
in mid-march and

2485
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,679
that is a simple uh use case we can also

2486
01:32:56,159 --> 01:33:01,120
combine the different

2487
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,639
uh the different uh uh utilities and

2488
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,440
different power chains together for

2489
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,400
example like

2490
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:08,639
if there is a zero knowledge uh power

2491
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,880
change to protect the token privacy

2492
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,080
we can combine them together with us and

2493
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,239
we can run a

2494
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,520
decentralized exchange on the final

2495
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:18,719
network side because

2496
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,440
uh the dax is more complicated than than

2497
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,600
token and

2498
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,719
and it's very hard to use zero knowledge

2499
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:28,320
proof to protect it

2500
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:31,040
yeah so that's all from my side yeah so

2501
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,679
uh we are going to launch a series of

2502
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,199
products

2503
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,800
in the near future and if you are

2504
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:37,120
interested feel free to

2505
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,320
like reach out to us on telegram you can

2506
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,880
also check our

2507
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:42,480
uh open source code on github thank you

2508
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,560
very much

2509
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:46,800
cool yeah let's get it started so i'm

2510
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,880
going to talk about plasma network and

2511
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,719
what we are doing right now so our

2512
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,719
mission is to make dao surprising

2513
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,480
network is community delivery margin

2514
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,000
change smart contract platform on

2515
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,800
polkadot

2516
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,719
so why crazy network plasma network is a

2517
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:03,120
multi-battery machine ducks hub on

2518
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,679
polkadot that support ethereum

2519
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,480
and the data solution so what do you

2520
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,639
mean by

2521
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,719
multi-battery machines so we support

2522
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,679
both ethereum virtual machine

2523
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,960
and web assembly so you can deploy

2524
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,040
solidity contract

2525
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,320
by by contract on the top of ethereum

2526
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:21,520
battery machine today

2527
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:24,560
by using the mix metamask truffle

2528
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,719
ecdss signature or whatever and

2529
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:29,520
you can deploy ink contract on the top

2530
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:32,320
of our assembly

2531
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,440
in the yeah we are also implementing

2532
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,639
zika lola

2533
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:39,040
so why scaling solution for polkadot

2534
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:41,199
polkadot is also a scaling solution so

2535
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,840
this is a really good question

2536
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:44,400
i think is many ethereum projects will

2537
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,840
use

2538
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:50,480
a lot of you know load up solution

2539
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,600
and then um it's going to be easy for

2540
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:55,040
them to migrate

2541
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,760
from ethereum to polkadot space without

2542
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:59,600
compromising roll up solution

2543
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,360
because we have low laps on the

2544
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,760
topography network

2545
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,480
so plasma networks make it easy to

2546
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,000
create

2547
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:10,320
launch and use steps and the

2548
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,040
actually we have been working on zika

2549
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:15,920
lola and the 50 percent is done

2550
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:18,639
and it's under the review by website

2551
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,199
foundation right now

2552
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,119
so far we have been building on polka

2553
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:26,159
dots since 2019

2554
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:29,520
and the about our huge milestone in 2021

2555
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:31,119
is to become sama para chain as well as

2556
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,920
forgot of parachain

2557
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,800
and we have been working on mercy

2558
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,239
bachelor muslim

2559
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,000
israeli bachelor machine and web

2560
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:40,480
assembly both only

2561
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,639
one and layer two so you can deploy any

2562
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,560
sort of contract on the top of layer one

2563
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,239
as well as there two

2564
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:50,560
so if you are uh interested in cheaper

2565
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,360
gas or faster finality or flexible apps

2566
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,040
developments

2567
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,800
so you can deploy dabs on the top of

2568
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,800
rear two

2569
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,840
but also you can deploy it up on the top

2570
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,920
of layer one

2571
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,480
and they also that the huge difference

2572
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:05,119
between plasma network and the

2573
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:07,679
other project is doubts taking i'm going

2574
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:10,080
to talk about upstaking radar

2575
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,520
and this is our technical achievements

2576
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,520
we became the

2577
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,719
power chain and we deployed a smart

2578
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,000
contract on the top of

2579
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,719
our test net power chain and the i think

2580
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,800
tomorrow

2581
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,719
or day after tomorrow i'm going we are

2582
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,040
going to support ethereum battery

2583
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:25,040
machine

2584
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:31,360
so you can deploy solidity contract or

2585
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:32,880
bypass contract on the topo polka dot

2586
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,280
test net power chain

2587
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,920
instead of independent chain or isolate

2588
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:40,560
data chain so this is gonna be very huge

2589
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,280
you know upgrade for us

2590
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,719
yeah and also we are making bridges like

2591
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,639
ethereum bridges

2592
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,800
and secret network bridge and finance

2593
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:51,280
smart chain bridge

2594
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,679
so humans will be talking about secret

2595
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:56,719
network bridge data

2596
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:59,760
yeah uh and last week uh we have done

2597
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,000
xcmep con uh transaction between acara

2598
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,960
and

2599
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,199
brazen so interpretability was possible

2600
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,920
but it became reality

2601
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:09,760
so we are going to work with inter a and

2602
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,360
other projects to make

2603
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:15,760
crochet messaging passing happen

2604
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,679
yeah and also i'm going to talk about

2605
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,880
our new

2606
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:24,159
yeah portal

2607
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,600
so this is the ui and the anyone can

2608
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:29,440
create dabs

2609
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,199
by yes through this plus network portal

2610
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,280
all you have to do is you have to

2611
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:36,080
specify account

2612
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,760
and they fill out your you know website

2613
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,239
and figure out your name

2614
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,239
and the you know category it can be

2615
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,119
defined it can be you know power change

2616
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:46,800
it can be

2617
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:49,440
oracle it can be gaming and also the

2618
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,080
last things is to upload

2619
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:53,679
um web assembly contract or solidity

2620
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:56,719
contract here

2621
01:37:53,679 --> 01:38:00,000
and then sorry it's not interactive but

2622
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:02,560
we are going to launch it in weeks

2623
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,440
then let's say chain link deploy oracle

2624
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,639
on the top of

2625
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:09,840
the network the logo will be shown here

2626
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:12,719
and the yeah prm token holder can stay

2627
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,280
they are talking not only on network

2628
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:16,800
like

2629
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:20,000
staking but also on dubs so let's say

2630
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,960
let's say um unisoft join the plaza

2631
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,440
network

2632
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,520
so prepare a token holder can stake they

2633
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,920
are talking about uni swap

2634
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,600
by doing so you are supporting uni swap

2635
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,480
and the unicef the better offer parking

2636
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,239
um

2637
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:36,320
token on prm token this means

2638
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:38,400
uh by making dubs on the top of plaza

2639
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:42,560
network you can get prm token

2640
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,560
and it will be tradable when we discover

2641
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:48,080
this is gonna be simple but there is

2642
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:50,080
strong incentive for developer

2643
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,239
and the i think we got a question

2644
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:54,639
regarding uh

2645
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:56,080
lockdrop and we are also making the

2646
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,520
interface

2647
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,920
so you can join our lock drop during the

2648
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,880
the project auction through plus network

2649
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,880
portal

2650
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,719
so you can specify dot amount then you

2651
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,840
can get premium token if you deposit

2652
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:10,880
dots for us

2653
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,719
to become a power chain

2654
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:15,040
core and the infuser will be talking

2655
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:18,400
about

2656
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,600
yeah bridges in the we are working on

2657
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,280
secret network bridge

2658
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,440
in syrian bridge and banana small chain

2659
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,679
bridge uh we got fund

2660
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:28,560
from finance and the okay x so we have

2661
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,400
our incentive to make a bridges

2662
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:32,560
yeah and the ecosystem is getting bigger

2663
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:35,040
and bigger and bigger

2664
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,400
and the auto team joined our plaza

2665
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,320
network projects

2666
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,719
and we are going to launch grants

2667
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,560
program there is soon so it will be

2668
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,880
great if you could deploy it apps on the

2669
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:49,520
top operating network

2670
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,520
and i will leave it to himself

2671
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,480
all right thank you soda for passing uh

2672
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,800
let's just go through the in-depth of

2673
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,159
the

2674
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,239
bridge contract that we're trying to

2675
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:00,480
make right now so

2676
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,280
here's the uh bridge contract between

2677
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,960
the secret

2678
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:06,480
um so this is basically i mean i cannot

2679
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,280
go through the whole code but

2680
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,320
this is basically about this um like a

2681
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,880
multi-sig bridge

2682
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,679
where it when it executes the

2683
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,719
transaction

2684
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:19,199
then it just sends it the

2685
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,840
multisig bridge detects the txid and

2686
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:22,000
then

2687
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,119
signs those like uh transactions sends

2688
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,800
to a secret

2689
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:27,679
so uh you can add those like owners and

2690
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,119
then

2691
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:33,600
fee collectors for this bridge transfer

2692
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:35,520
and you can also add those tokens uh let

2693
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,360
me show you some work throughs so

2694
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,440
let's just say that it's just a poc

2695
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,560
though but let's just say you want to

2696
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,199
deploy a token

2697
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,520
uh and then probably compile it in a

2698
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:48,880
test net like

2699
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,679
here below like uh let's just say the

2700
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:54,400
initial supply is like

2701
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:55,199
1 million or something and then go with

2702
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,960
the test

2703
01:40:55,199 --> 01:41:05,840
and then test this one should be 18.

2704
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:05,840
so once you deploy it

2705
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:11,040
you have the token pending uh once it's

2706
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:14,159
deployed

2707
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:16,320
uh you get the token address from your

2708
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:19,199
dabs it could be your governance token

2709
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,119
or it could be some other erc20 like

2710
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:24,719
peck tokens or whatever

2711
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:27,040
then you just add the token to the

2712
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,040
bridge

2713
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,199
wait the minimum amount is like the

2714
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,080
minimum amount to stake

2715
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:34,080
so transact

2716
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,920
and once those tokens are on the bridge

2717
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,480
it will be available to move around this

2718
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,280
ui

2719
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,560
in a bridge like this so basically uh

2720
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:50,320
we're trying to include

2721
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:53,199
our own plasm and erc20 tokens

2722
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,400
such as like from the dabs or it could

2723
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:56,480
be other

2724
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,679
wrapped pocket asset tokens such as

2725
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,639
akala

2726
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:02,800
vala or other other rap tokens uh we're

2727
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:04,960
trying to put that between the secret

2728
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,400
and then secret will send those like

2729
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,119
tokens from ibc

2730
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:09,600
such as like tara it could be other like

2731
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,320
secret

2732
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,199
secret or secret tether and then it will

2733
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,840
move around

2734
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,560
with the secret build the script secret

2735
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,800
[ __ ]

2736
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,080
built with built with the multi-sig

2737
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,360
operators such as

2738
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:25,760
from like b harvest and the other

2739
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,040
multi-sig operator as well so this is

2740
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,520
basically how

2741
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,239
our multi-stick bridge will work i hope

2742
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,400
you guys build

2743
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:34,159
that and then let your assets to move

2744
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,880
around in heterogeneous

2745
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:38,560
blockchains such as cosmos polka dot and

2746
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:42,000
also binance chain

2747
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,760
thank you you know they find this all

2748
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,960
about covering decentralized finance

2749
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,920
wherever that may be

2750
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,800
so if it's thriving on polka dot i think

2751
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,719
you know i

2752
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,159
will probably see more and more polka

2753
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,960
dot based d5 coverage

2754
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:56,000
on on the defiant as well okay so um it

2755
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,440
looks like we we have

2756
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:03,600
our our panelists on board um

2757
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:07,520
great uh so there's our retail from

2758
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:09,980
akala lucas from centrifuge and aiden

2759
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,520
um from snowfort um

2760
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:14,560
[Music]

2761
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:17,119
welcome and um excited to chat about

2762
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,920
uh about d5 with you guys about what

2763
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:23,040
you're seeing

2764
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:26,159
on um the the future of uh polka dots

2765
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:29,360
um ecosystem

2766
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:32,719
but first um as i was looking uh

2767
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:35,280
or listening to your very impressive

2768
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:36,880
demos um i always had the question of

2769
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:41,360
like

2770
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:43,360
when um so can you kind of just clarify

2771
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,840
exactly what people can do

2772
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,560
uh with your your apps right now i know

2773
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,040
there's like

2774
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,159
alpha betas and like different greek

2775
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:53,360
letters but like

2776
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:56,719
are people like can people go and test

2777
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:58,960
uh yeah if we you can go through

2778
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,719
um the different kind of phases of

2779
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,480
development that uh your

2780
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,560
your different applications and projects

2781
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:08,080
are all right so uh retail can

2782
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,119
can you start oh yeah can can you hear

2783
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:12,639
me all right

2784
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:14,320
yeah okay awesome so um for arcola we

2785
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:16,239
pretty much already have the test net

2786
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:18,239
running for the past five months

2787
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,360
so everything that we demo can be

2788
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:21,360
accessible today

2789
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,639
about the key question about when like

2790
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:25,040
when will we go live

2791
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:25,679
on kusama or when we go live on polka

2792
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,600
dots

2793
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,040
well it all depends on the actual

2794
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,600
project and functionality

2795
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:33,199
and from the experience we're working

2796
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,199
with with the substrate team with some

2797
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:36,639
prosperity i think it will be ready when

2798
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:38,400
whatever is ready so

2799
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,320
uh we are all hopeful that you're gonna

2800
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,960
be released soon but we also hope for

2801
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,719
that um

2802
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,159
for the release it's going to be safe

2803
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,000
and smooth so

2804
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:47,520
i think it's getting close i don't have

2805
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,440
a definitive date but i think you will

2806
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,719
be ready when it's ready

2807
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:55,920
all right okay um i guess like

2808
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:59,119
this this all depends on uh when

2809
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,719
like polka dot and and the pertains

2810
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:02,960
launch itself but you're saying that

2811
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,119
when that happens then akala will be

2812
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,480
will be ready to go basically yeah and

2813
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:08,639
and i think there will be um

2814
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,880
notice there will be announcement from

2815
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,239
either um alcala or from officially from

2816
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,760
pogada or from parity

2817
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,440
um to let the world know that now the

2818
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,360
power chain option is coming because

2819
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,760
this is the unbounding periods that we

2820
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,520
will

2821
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,600
um the people have to unbound their

2822
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,760
token to support power chains so

2823
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,760
um i don't think that there needs to be

2824
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,360
rush or that this should be like a date

2825
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,920
that we need to set but when it's coming

2826
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,719
we all

2827
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,000
we will always be notified um

2828
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:35,280
accordingly

2829
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:37,040
okay when when do you expect um

2830
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,400
to have to have this like very chain

2831
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,040
option happen i know you said like

2832
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,199
there's no

2833
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,040
specific date but is this like a matter

2834
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:46,880
of do you guys know a matter of like

2835
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:48,320
weeks or or months or anyone have like

2836
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,880
an idea

2837
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,600
um i think we can all guess i think

2838
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,960
ideon

2839
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:56,960
and luke as we can all guess but my um

2840
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,880
i think we're getting close on kusama i

2841
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,880
mean that's not

2842
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,550
[Laughter]

2843
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,600
i available in a way we are we already

2844
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:19,840
are ready

2845
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:20,480
um we so i alluded it in in the demo but

2846
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,679
like we

2847
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:26,560
have been building on ethereum to

2848
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:28,880
like three years ago uh made the

2849
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,000
decision actually to work on substrate

2850
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,000
builds build out

2851
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,119
way before pulpit went live i think it

2852
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,480
was

2853
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,800
um it was march of last year um that we

2854
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,480
went

2855
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,400
live with our mainnet and so our mainnet

2856
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,800
today is actually

2857
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,800
um an almost identical copy of polkadot

2858
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,400
so same consensus mechanism

2859
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,080
no relay chains of course or we're just

2860
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:51,600
an independent state chain but

2861
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:54,880
um so we have that and and sort of

2862
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,400
like for us like the pieces there's a

2863
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,480
small part of our infrastructure that is

2864
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,080
running on that chain it's how

2865
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,920
the different loans are originated and

2866
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:04,880
then investors sort of

2867
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,159
use uh tin lake on ethereum because

2868
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:08,400
that's where the liquidity is that's

2869
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:09,600
where all the the dfa ecosystem is today

2870
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,600
so we sort of have this

2871
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,440
hybrid approach today of our own chain

2872
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,239
and um

2873
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:17,360
and ethereum we have our own bridge uh

2874
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:21,119
for that

2875
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:22,480
um and as far chains become available

2876
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,280
when they're big when they become

2877
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,199
available

2878
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,520
um that is something that um of course

2879
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:30,320
we're very excited to

2880
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,760
to start using but it doesn't really um

2881
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:34,800
hinder us from using

2882
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:37,920
using uh sort of our tech already

2883
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:40,880
yep i think um now 4.6 million

2884
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,520
die in like loans outstanding from

2885
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,960
different

2886
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:48,840
um uh borrowers and uh like have

2887
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,080
a ton of users growing every day in on

2888
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,119
ethereum

2889
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,360
right um yeah i guess yeah i know uh

2890
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:57,760
centrifuge is like what i i meant will

2891
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,560
it be ready to go on polka dot as as

2892
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,679
soon as it's

2893
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:04,320
yeah yeah so we're on the latest

2894
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,960
uh version of substrate in our test net

2895
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,800
we have

2896
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,000
our main nets slightly behind but this

2897
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,400
is something we're working on cha cha

2898
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,800
cha is what we're using to test

2899
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,480
a lot of integration but yeah i guess as

2900
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,159
um

2901
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,520
as power chain options will go live

2902
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:19,440
we'll be able to take basically our

2903
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,040
runtime that we have today that's tested

2904
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:24,880
and running in production and

2905
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:29,360
and sort of deploy that cool

2906
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:29,360
all right and um aidan how about for you

2907
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:33,280
yeah so we're pretty much in a similar

2908
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,119
position to to the others

2909
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,719
we are expecting to be pretty much ready

2910
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,600
to launch at the same time that power

2911
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,280
change launch

2912
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,280
and so we're kind of waiting on parity

2913
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,639
for that there are a few differences um

2914
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,040
our power chain

2915
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:46,639
does require some new functionality that

2916
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:48,639
doesn't really exist on

2917
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,239
polka dots test night yet and so we're

2918
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:52,480
kind of using a custom branch

2919
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,679
uh we do expect that functionality to be

2920
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,119
merged into

2921
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:57,520
like main required contest net and

2922
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:59,840
eventually polka dot at the same time

2923
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,440
as prior change and so when everyone

2924
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,639
eventually converges to

2925
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,679
production uh we'll be there at start um

2926
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:07,840
but

2927
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:09,119
um we are kind of blocked on that and

2928
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,520
and so we have like an internal test

2929
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,199
nets

2930
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,199
we're planning to launch a public-facing

2931
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:15,440
demo in the next few weeks

2932
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:16,719
um but in terms of like production

2933
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,440
assets and real world efforts from

2934
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:19,520
ethereum

2935
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,520
there it only happened whenever parrot

2936
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:25,440
parodies ready with power chains

2937
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:29,199
okay cool um and so you you all expect

2938
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:32,239
to have your own paritanes on polka dot

2939
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:36,639
is that right yeah yeah okay

2940
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:39,679
um and so my question on on peritones um

2941
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:41,040
is especially for d5 because

2942
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:44,400
interoperability has

2943
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:47,920
proven to be so key on ethereum d5

2944
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:50,719
this concept of money legos um

2945
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,599
does it work in exactly the same way

2946
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:55,360
with

2947
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:58,639
uh dabs built on different paritains

2948
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:01,599
like is interoperability as seamless as

2949
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:02,159
um applications being built on the same

2950
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,360
exact

2951
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:06,320
layer one i would say that um there's no

2952
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:09,119
fundamental

2953
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:10,400
areas to preventing that seamlessness so

2954
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:13,040
like one minor difference

2955
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:14,639
is that when um someone if someone's

2956
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,000
using a dab on one power chain

2957
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,920
that is interacting with adapt on

2958
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,119
another chain that interaction happens

2959
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,840
asynchronously

2960
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:23,599
and so um instead of like there being a

2961
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,560
single atomic transaction like you would

2962
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,480
have on ethereum

2963
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,840
there may be two transactions but that's

2964
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,440
more kind of a technical thing

2965
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,520
um if you look at the user experience of

2966
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:33,360
say using ethereum you're waiting

2967
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,960
for like a minute or longer for

2968
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,920
confirmation times and for things to

2969
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,840
happen anyway

2970
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,960
and so when multiple power chains are

2971
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,880
interacting with each other

2972
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,080
the amount of time that it takes for

2973
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:45,199
these um

2974
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:47,119
multi-atomic transactions to happen will

2975
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:48,320
likely still be faster than if you were

2976
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:49,520
to just wait for a single ethereum

2977
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,719
transaction

2978
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:54,000
and so i don't really see there being ux

2979
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,280
compromises it's more kind of on the

2980
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,080
technical side and the way that

2981
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,639
developers

2982
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:59,360
have to think about things that change i

2983
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,040
think that

2984
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,639
i always use this analogy and you

2985
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,040
brought up async right i always

2986
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,000
use this analogy like when you build the

2987
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,239
website 20 years

2988
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,119
ago you created your like one php file

2989
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,560
and it

2990
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:12,239
pulled everything together and like

2991
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,159
served you then this website

2992
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:16,080
and you would load one request from the

2993
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:17,679
from the server and you get all you need

2994
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:19,040
and that's sort of like ethereum today

2995
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,880
right you submit your transaction

2996
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:23,840
everything happens atomically

2997
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,800
um and it's great it's easy um but it

2998
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,840
doesn't scale and

2999
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:29,760
for the same reasons like when you go to

3000
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,599
a website today actually

3001
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,800
there's probably 30 different things

3002
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:34,000
that happen in the background which are

3003
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,239
also asynchronous

3004
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,080
transactions but in the end you end up

3005
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:39,440
with that same website being rendered

3006
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:42,719
right and there's a bit of

3007
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:44,560
composition and so um like

3008
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:46,719
d5 will look for from an engineering

3009
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,280
perspective radically different

3010
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:51,040
um under the hood but yeah i think i

3011
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:54,080
agree on the usability that can be

3012
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:55,360
um very similar and and even on ethereum

3013
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:58,320
right like you see

3014
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:59,280
the l2 space will have exactly the same

3015
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,040
issues

3016
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:03,119
and so i think we're like it's going to

3017
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,400
be um it's just not going to be a

3018
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,840
reality anymore that most of these

3019
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:08,400
things will happen synchronously

3020
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:09,840
like you'll jump from l1 to l2 and from

3021
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,920
one chain to another

3022
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,840
and protocols and users will learn how

3023
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,880
to use it how to

3024
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:20,320
implement that stuff

3025
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:22,800
um yeah retail there uh something to add

3026
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:24,639
yeah i think that's a great an analogy

3027
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,960
by by lucas uh it's like it

3028
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,560
you feel like um the current um

3029
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,560
ethereum.evm application

3030
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,560
is like a mainframe computer and we are

3031
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,560
moving slowly towards like the

3032
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,760
server age which like each um

3033
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,480
specialized networks

3034
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,239
is on its own server and um we can see

3035
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,679
this is like different approach um to

3036
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,480
solve the same problem our theory on

3037
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,480
this layer too

3038
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,159
unpopular this project and i think

3039
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,440
that's exactly why this uh technical

3040
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,920
working group are formed

3041
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,560
as a community driven tech tech uh group

3042
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,280
of like

3043
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:54,880
we need to find at least like the token

3044
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,400
can be circulating freely

3045
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,000
between all the different projects so we

3046
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,960
have a an

3047
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,880
interface to talk with each other so i

3048
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:04,880
think that is like the very beginning of

3049
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,520
the compostability that we can already

3050
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,239
see

3051
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,800
i do believe in further development down

3052
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:12,639
into the

3053
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:15,199
poker developments we can see richer

3054
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:16,880
compatibility for example a power chair

3055
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:18,639
might decide to expose

3056
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,719
some of its core functionality through

3057
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,400
the xcm that means for example a project

3058
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:25,920
might decide to expose

3059
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,800
the attacks or in centrifuge cases might

3060
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,320
expose their

3061
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,920
characterization or their financial

3062
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,599
assets through xcm pandora

3063
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,119
so that can be also be composable as

3064
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,639
well but for now i think the bare

3065
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,480
minimum is that the token is already

3066
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:40,000
circulating and that's great

3067
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:41,040
okay so um different tokens issued on

3068
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,440
different pertains

3069
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:45,040
can like easily circulate on other

3070
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,719
proteins even though they have

3071
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,719
they may have different parameters and

3072
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:51,360
be built on on different ways

3073
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,760
they can still kind of like interconnect

3074
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,960
with

3075
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:57,040
with different applications there yeah

3076
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,719
and i think on powerchain it's more of

3077
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,000
like a diplomatic relationship between

3078
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:00,960
different projects because they are

3079
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,040
soviet network

3080
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,320
it's just a very easy to build up

3081
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,639
relationship um

3082
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:08,000
and and have this value transfer in a

3083
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,840
trustless way

3084
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,119
and i think now in the past there's like

3085
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:14,880
the spree um

3086
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:16,800
at the sp ie environment so project can

3087
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,960
actually talk to other projects

3088
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,360
without going through the relation and

3089
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:23,520
that's where i think the most

3090
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,639
scalable interpretation communication

3091
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,800
gonna happen

3092
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:29,440
okay so something like urine which is

3093
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:32,639
basically like a yield bouncer between

3094
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:36,159
like dozens of different ethereum defy

3095
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:38,639
apps and it's just like it it needs to

3096
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:39,440
to connect to and plug into all these

3097
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,840
different apps

3098
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,880
that would still be possible on on polka

3099
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,440
dot d5

3100
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,719
i think so and i i wouldn't um discount

3101
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:49,040
the possibility that is

3102
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,119
going to be like an aggregator approach

3103
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,880
and that's going to harvest all the

3104
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,400
different rewards from different

3105
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,360
projects for example centrifuge has a

3106
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,360
money market

3107
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,280
um this financial instrument that can be

3108
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:01,360
um can be can be harvested

3109
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,639
um with the snowfall bridge there could

3110
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,159
be like ethereum

3111
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:06,480
yield that can be harvested so there

3112
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:07,679
might be um down in the past of

3113
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:11,040
development

3114
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:14,719
cool um lucas i i i'm wondering

3115
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:16,560
about a team's building like you on on

3116
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:19,360
a polka dot and other things like

3117
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,480
ethereum is there a concern about

3118
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:23,040
fragmenting

3119
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:24,639
um liquidity like does it make sense to

3120
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:28,000
build on different chains

3121
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:31,199
or will do you think um

3122
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,679
teams would consolidate on one chain in

3123
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:36,000
the long run

3124
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:38,400
so that's a really good question i don't

3125
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,199
i i think

3126
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,080
the one the one like obviously fragment

3127
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:45,280
liquidity is bad

3128
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,000
we want to avoid that um it also though

3129
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,599
is very easy

3130
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,520
to move liquidity around and actually

3131
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:49,840
like you just mentioned urine right like

3132
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,679
that

3133
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,280
that's all they're doing and you can you

3134
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,040
can do that very easily

3135
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,280
for us like sort of how we think about

3136
01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:00,000
our like our ecosystem is

3137
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:01,280
we have two different two fundamentally

3138
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,800
different kinds of users we have the

3139
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,159
asset originators that bring these real

3140
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,960
world assets on chain

3141
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:07,440
they use our our power chain to create

3142
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,800
these

3143
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:13,599
assets investors then that will invest

3144
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,000
and earn earn interest on these assets

3145
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,920
they

3146
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,760
don't necessarily need to be on

3147
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,320
centrifuge chain they can do

3148
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,960
um they might be a maker on ethereum

3149
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,639
they might

3150
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,000
be on a caller like it might be

3151
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:27,119
collateral somewhere

3152
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,239
um or who knows right and so for us how

3153
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:30,239
we think about

3154
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:31,840
fragmentation and interoperability is

3155
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:33,599
like like we want

3156
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,599
these investors to be wherever we ever

3157
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:36,480
necessary and we make it as easy to move

3158
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:38,000
these tokens

3159
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,840
on the acid originator side that's like

3160
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,040
sort of the heavy usage like a lot of

3161
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,599
the very specific

3162
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:44,880
interaction that we need happens right

3163
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:46,960
it's not just a simple

3164
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,639
erc20 token transfer fungible token

3165
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:49,040
transfer and so that's sort of how we

3166
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:52,000
split

3167
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:52,800
it up um and how we think about like

3168
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,800
avoiding this

3169
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:58,639
like fragmentation okay yeah like

3170
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:00,239
i would say to add to that the problem

3171
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:00,800
of fragmentation of liquidity is not

3172
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:02,239
really

3173
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,440
a cross-chain problem like even if you

3174
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,320
look at ethereum there's multiple

3175
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,840
protocols and

3176
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:07,599
default applications where liquidity has

3177
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,199
really become fragmented and so whether

3178
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,639
that fragmentation happens across chains

3179
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:13,440
or across protocols or

3180
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:14,239
across people and communities um it's

3181
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,719
kind of a

3182
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:17,760
more general uh conversation around how

3183
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,440
do we join and

3184
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,719
separate liquidity whether on the

3185
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:22,400
technical level that happens on

3186
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,080
different chains or different protocols

3187
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,840
i think it's more of like a kind of

3188
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,400
technical implementation detail rather

3189
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,599
than

3190
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:33,119
uh financial product consideration

3191
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:35,199
sure um what are some some of the

3192
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:37,199
incentives that that you think will be

3193
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:38,239
used in polka dot d5 to bring over

3194
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:41,920
liquidity from

3195
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:45,360
from ethereum and um i don't know like

3196
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:47,840
snowfall as the bridge is uh obviously

3197
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:48,800
key in making this happen in in getting

3198
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,520
liquidity from

3199
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,400
kind of the biggest d5 ecosystem right

3200
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,199
now

3201
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:56,400
are you thinking of of having incentives

3202
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:59,679
for people

3203
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:03,440
uh to put their tokens over or same for

3204
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:05,040
for a cal and centrifuge yeah so

3205
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:06,800
i mean we're going to have incentives

3206
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,000
that make it easy for people to put

3207
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,760
their tokens over

3208
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,199
but we're not currently planning to have

3209
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,719
additional incentives

3210
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:14,320
to specifically entice people to bring

3211
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,119
their tokens over i think that will come

3212
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:17,119
more from

3213
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:18,400
the being enticed by other power chains

3214
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:19,920
and other kind of protocols

3215
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:22,080
for example if there's your nakala or

3216
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,840
yodan centrifuge um our links to

3217
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:26,159
alkaline centrifuge and other chains

3218
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,280
will be uh pathways from ethereum into

3219
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:30,560
them and so

3220
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,199
essentially we uh we're kind of counting

3221
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,080
on them

3222
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:35,840
to entice people to deliver demand into

3223
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:38,719
the polkadot ecosystem

3224
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,239
right yeah i can echo that so i mean we

3225
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,320
will definitely have some form of

3226
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:43,920
incentive when we launch the network and

3227
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:45,840
we will also able to direct the

3228
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,599
incentive to where it's most needed for

3229
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,880
example if we think i'm more ethereum

3230
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:50,320
assets need to be crossed

3231
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,000
and that's the beauty of like this

3232
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,639
composable network right so we can say

3233
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,119
that hey

3234
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:56,560
um we can provide incentive on making

3235
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:58,960
new uh snowys

3236
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,159
or we can provide a new incentive on

3237
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,800
creating

3238
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:05,440
a long position using yeast um so all

3239
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:06,159
depends on where the demands is we think

3240
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:08,320
it's going to

3241
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:09,679
um to hit so well this is like the

3242
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:12,159
beautiful of like have

3243
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:14,080
one consumer focus application that has

3244
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:16,000
a bridge that we can work together

3245
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,199
and make this is like as frictionless

3246
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
and as um as

3247
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:20,960
useful for all for the trade as possible

3248
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,560
um

3249
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:27,040
so you're farming on anakala

3250
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,239
well i wouldn't call that uh yeah it

3251
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,960
will be similar but

3252
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:32,239
there will be actual um more meaningful

3253
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,960
product out of alkaline

3254
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:36,639
i think there's like um after eu farming

3255
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,800
i think the staking dealership um

3256
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:39,920
gam is going to have a very heavy play

3257
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,960
um the actual

3258
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,239
dot has u built-in so we have some very

3259
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,000
interesting product that we might be

3260
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:48,239
able to introduce once we go live

3261
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,040
or revolving around the actual staking

3262
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:51,840
rewards

3263
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:53,599
um so for for early traders tap into the

3264
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,560
system not only they will be earnings

3265
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:56,960
for example um

3266
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,400
um incentive on the on the network token

3267
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,880
they might also tap into the

3268
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:03,280
uh the rewarding part of the actual pls

3269
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:06,159
network like dot rewards kusama reward

3270
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:08,320
um and if you if you put those into play

3271
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:12,000
that is actually very very interesting

3272
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:15,119
oh interesting okay um cool and

3273
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,840
uh lucas for you like how how do you

3274
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:18,320
think uh

3275
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:20,880
you'll incentivize people to use uh

3276
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:24,000
centrifuge and polka dot

3277
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:27,199
i mean right now it costs around

3278
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,360
100 or more for one of our asset

3279
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:31,280
originators to originate alone

3280
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:33,040
um i think is that's already a pretty

3281
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:36,480
strong incentive to

3282
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:38,560
not use ethereum um i mean

3283
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,599
in the end like the yield farming you

3284
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,960
have to watch out there it doesn't

3285
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,199
become a bit of a race to the bottom

3286
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,440
it's

3287
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:45,520
i think a very interesting way to start

3288
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:49,520
a community and there can be a way that

3289
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:51,440
like as a community you decide um

3290
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,560
where you want to direct attention and

3291
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:55,599
that i think is

3292
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,159
is super valuable um but but ultimately

3293
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,639
like

3294
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:59,440
i believe the usability that polka dot

3295
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:02,400
can offer

3296
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,440
and the the transaction costs are going

3297
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:06,159
to be

3298
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:08,000
what will drive a lot of it um another

3299
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:11,119
thing right is just

3300
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,760
um polka dot itself the the activity the

3301
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:15,360
market cap like the the purity

3302
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,880
just the amounts of liquidity in this

3303
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:19,760
whole ecosystem

3304
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:22,639
are now already so big that um i think

3305
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:25,440
this can be like a viable

3306
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:27,119
um a very viable like early pool of

3307
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:30,400
liquidity and users

3308
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:33,679
i mean it's the top top five

3309
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:34,560
you know top ten uh how many where are

3310
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:37,840
they right now

3311
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,280
um so it's and that is like that can

3312
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,880
start right and it's and i think sort of

3313
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:43,679
if you start with that then

3314
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,760
um liquidity will find its way right

3315
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:46,560
like if we see something about d5 it's

3316
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:49,040
like

3317
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,760
there's hardly any um any free lunch

3318
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,599
left on that

3319
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,800
anything free left on the table so you

3320
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,520
can you'll see

3321
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,360
like money flowing where there's like

3322
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,400
cheap transactions scalability

3323
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:01,119
uh liquidity and so i i would focus on

3324
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:03,480
that

3325
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:05,440
um as opposed to too much of like

3326
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:08,560
subsidizing it

3327
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,480
oh yeah yeah

3328
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,639
we're seeing it with like finance chain

3329
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:13,920
um finance martin people going there

3330
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:15,920
even though it's not

3331
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,960
necessarily kind of the most

3332
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:21,199
decentralized

3333
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:24,560
etc but of course like money talks smart

3334
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:28,159
cheap transactions matter um

3335
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:31,920
so okay so going looking

3336
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:34,239
um forward and and seeing where define

3337
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,679
on polka dot is heading where do you see

3338
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:39,599
this ecosystem

3339
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:41,840
um being at the end of the year like how

3340
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:42,719
how how big do you think it would be how

3341
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,280
many

3342
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:47,280
applications um do you think it will be

3343
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:48,880
comparable to what is happening on

3344
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:51,840
ethereum today i mean

3345
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:53,440
do you see uh something like tvl on

3346
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,119
polka dot overtaking

3347
02:02:53,440 --> 02:03:00,320
ethereum's tbl by the end of the year

3348
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:00,719
um i don't i don't think um you will be

3349
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,199
grown

3350
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:04,800
at that scale but i do think there's

3351
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:06,719
some something that unique will be

3352
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,599
created in the polkadot ecosystem

3353
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,360
uh with one project um connectable um

3354
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:12,800
composable with other projects

3355
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:14,639
i think we're able to see something

3356
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,080
that's very very unique for example

3357
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:17,920
on the fallout team demonstrate like a

3358
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:18,560
privacy layer so we can start to see

3359
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,040
like

3360
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:23,040
one project asset and teleport it to the

3361
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:24,400
path harvest layer and become a privacy

3362
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,159
asset

3363
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:28,639
so i think that's something that's super

3364
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:30,719
interesting and that might be the

3365
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:33,040
the new possibility that we can start to

3366
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:36,320
see i i do expect the polkadots

3367
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:39,199
ecosystem grow um and grow fast but i

3368
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:40,639
i really don't think um at a scale that

3369
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:42,400
maybe by the end of the

3370
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:43,840
day the yeah that we can take over but

3371
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:46,320
the thing is that it's like

3372
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:48,239
um at the point i see it is that this

3373
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:50,719
whole movement this whole

3374
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:52,800
decentralized finance movement is very

3375
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:56,159
very early on right so there's like

3376
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:57,440
a huge growing pie for what i i'm gonna

3377
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:59,440
be honest i think it's gonna

3378
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:01,199
replace the whole financial sector so we

3379
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:03,440
are still in a very early stage

3380
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:04,639
and each one of us working on this

3381
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:07,280
sector is just like

3382
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:08,719
uh reinforcing this idea or pushing this

3383
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:11,280
idea to the world so

3384
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:12,880
in that sense um i i would see that i'd

3385
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:14,560
rather to see that we grow together

3386
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,040
rather than say hey it's taking over or

3387
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:20,480
something like that

3388
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:23,280
i agree um yeah

3389
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:24,239
aiden what are your thoughts on kind of

3390
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,079
long term for

3391
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:28,000
or end of the year at least for a

3392
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:30,880
defiant polka dot

3393
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
yeah i mean i'm not going to make like

3394
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,280
predictions about

3395
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,480
uh whether or not i think ethereum's

3396
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,199
going to take over i think it's very

3397
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,800
unlikely

3398
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:38,320
but i do think that like as soon as

3399
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:39,760
power chains are launched and

3400
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:41,119
within two or three months of people

3401
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,239
starting to connect to each other

3402
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:44,159
there'll be like

3403
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,360
uh a lot of flow happening between

3404
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:47,520
polkadot and ethereum and

3405
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,719
a lot of flow moving across power chains

3406
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,800
and so um

3407
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,480
i i imagine that like maybe not in terms

3408
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,960
of tvo um

3409
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:56,800
like overtaking ethereum but in terms of

3410
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,560
kind of transactions and usage and

3411
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,000
like people playing with things i could

3412
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:02,400
imagine um it's scaling

3413
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,880
like pretty quickly in that sense

3414
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,880
interesting

3415
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:09,679
because when i make your for your

3416
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:11,920
predictions

3417
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,199
i mean maybe the one prediction i do i

3418
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,040
will make it as well but

3419
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:17,840
i i expect power change to be live by

3420
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:19,679
then but maybe

3421
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:21,199
to come back to your first question but

3422
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:24,320
uh no i um

3423
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:27,119
i would say yeah i

3424
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:28,159
i think sort of boring of like alex i'm

3425
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:30,400
like

3426
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:32,480
every long crypto bed i've made in my

3427
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:34,000
life i've probably been wrong about so i

3428
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:35,920
don't want to say too much but

3429
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,400
the thing i have seen is sort of the def

3430
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,199
like the d5 ecosystem in in ethereum

3431
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,280
developing

3432
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:43,040
was and i think it's really important

3433
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:45,119
was

3434
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,800
accelerated by like just the whole

3435
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:47,280
community coming around the euroc20

3436
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:49,440
token

3437
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,560
and it sort of happened naturally and we

3438
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:53,280
had this like

3439
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:55,679
suddenly this number of tokens after the

3440
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:57,440
2017 ico boom that people started doing

3441
02:05:55,679 --> 02:06:01,760
things with and experimenting with

3442
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:03,920
and it still took um then like from 2018

3443
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,599
to 2019 and they sort of

3444
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,360
started growing and like last summer it

3445
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,599
was like really exploding and

3446
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,719
it's been going ever since but sort of

3447
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:13,360
we've seen this

3448
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:15,440
this whole um journey for ethereum and i

3449
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:17,280
think we can learn as like the polka dot

3450
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:18,800
community we can learn a lot from that

3451
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,800
i think the thing we can learn from it

3452
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,840
and where we can make sure that we don't

3453
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,239
go through this long

3454
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,320
long and slow like ramp up phase before

3455
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:29,119
if you get the hockey stick right

3456
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:30,480
um is we we make sure we actually can

3457
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:31,920
standardize around something and

3458
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,960
actually collaborate from very early on

3459
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,520
because that's always something the

3460
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,159
project

3461
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,719
that i define theorem profited hugely of

3462
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:38,800
right

3463
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:40,239
and then we can look at um like all

3464
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:41,599
these other developments that are

3465
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,840
happening ethereum will have like so

3466
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:45,920
much of the

3467
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,320
necessary pieces already figured out

3468
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,000
that

3469
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:49,360
just didn't exist like how long did it

3470
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,840
take for the first stable coin to go

3471
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,920
live

3472
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:53,440
how long did it take for the second one

3473
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,880
um how long did it take for the first

3474
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,960
amm to go live

3475
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,119
and so like we're starting with like a

3476
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,760
big a big head start here right and so i

3477
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,840
think that

3478
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:04,719
that can be something that we focus on

3479
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,800
and sort of bootstrap this ecosystem

3480
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:07,840
yeah yeah i definitely agree that

3481
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,400
ethereum has

3482
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,760
paved the way for other dfi ecosystems

3483
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,880
kind of building the

3484
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:16,639
the key infrastructure pieces um

3485
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,639
and then everyone can learn from that

3486
02:07:16,639 --> 02:07:21,199
and and improve hopefully

3487
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:23,679
um so is there a like something like a

3488
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:24,960
near c20 token standard on on polka dot

3489
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:28,159
or

3490
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:30,719
or not yet like a token standard

3491
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:32,159
i think the uh this is not equivalent to

3492
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,159
that because it's like sharon talking to

3493
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:37,280
chen but there is like the

3494
02:07:34,159 --> 02:07:39,520
a group of community projects working

3495
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,040
towards something that's like token um

3496
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,280
it's i wouldn't call it the token

3497
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:45,599
standard it's multiplied um

3498
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:46,719
value transfer uh across different chain

3499
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:50,560
uh of course

3500
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:51,040
different network okay super interesting

3501
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,920
um

3502
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:55,280
okay so we we need to wrap up so so i

3503
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:58,719
can chat with the other

3504
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:02,000
founders uh but super interesting um

3505
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:04,639
i i'll be keeping track of what you guys

3506
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
feel and yeah and i'll be covering it on

3507
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,880
the defined as well so

3508
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,920

3520
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:41,599
all your presentations again like really

3521
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:43,679
mind-blowing all the

3522
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:44,639
um building and development that's

3523
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:46,800
happening on

3524
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:47,840
on polka dot uh super excited to see

3525
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:50,960
everything live

3526
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,840
so i'll start with the same question i

3527
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:55,360
did for the

3528
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:58,079
the previous panel um and

3529
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:59,440
yeah where in kind of your each of your

3530
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:02,400
development phases

3531
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:04,400
are you and do you expect to be live as

3532
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:09,199
soon as the

3533
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:11,040
proteins are the protein auction happens

3534
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:12,239
um derek do you want to start sure thing

3535
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:14,560
yeah so um

3536
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:16,239
uh you know i i would say that uh

3537
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,199
largely similar to some of the responses

3538
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:19,040
you got from the previous

3539
02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:21,119
panelists you know where we are you know

3540
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:23,280
working hard to be kind of ready to go

3541
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:24,639
uh when the parrot chain auctions start

3542
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:26,480
i think um

3543
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,960
you know it was also mentioned that uh

3544
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:30,400
um you know it's you know i know parity

3545
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,440
has this policy of conducts ready when

3546
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,560
it's ready so um

3547
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,239
you know that always takes a little bit

3548
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,040
of creative juggling to you know kind of

3549
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:37,760
plan around

3550
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:39,119
um but uh you know uh we see kind of a

3551
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:41,119
ton of great progress happening

3552
02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:42,800
um you know on the development side and

3553
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:44,320
in particular i think that the key area

3554
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,040
for us is this development

3555
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:47,360
of cumulus and um you know making sure

3556
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,599
that

3557
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:50,400
it has all the features uh and stability

3558
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:52,400
that are needed

3559
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:53,440
uh to launch and you know i anticipate

3560
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:55,440
that happening

3561
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:56,719
uh you know uh you know relatively soon

3562
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:58,000
and you know we want to be among you

3563
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,800
know ready to go among the first pair of

3564
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,719
chains um

3565
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:06,480
you know as those auction store okay

3566
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:07,760
um alexa sure

3567
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:10,400
i mean i think we're all in the same

3568
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,360
boat um i mean as for insulin pokebit

3569
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:13,360
you see

3570
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:15,599
we just launched a beta test net that's

3571
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,520
kind of the system being feature ready

3572
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:18,880
from now on it's tweaks improvements on

3573
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:21,599
the ux and

3574
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:23,920
plus testing making sure it's robust um

3575
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:26,320
but we'll be ready to go whenever kusama

3576
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:28,079
and polkadot launch so from now on it's

3577
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,520
just making sure the system's robust

3578
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:30,719
that we keep improving and adding

3579
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:34,079
integrations

3580
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:35,920
okay cool sorry for moonbeam there's

3581
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:38,400
also a beta that people can start

3582
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,840
uh building on now right oh sure we've

3583
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,360
had a you know a test net since

3584
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,119
september basically like where

3585
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:44,320
we have teams like sushi who you heard

3586
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:45,440
from before and other you know many

3587
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,800
other teams are deploying

3588
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:49,760
uh you know deploying their applications

3589
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:53,840
to it yeah perfect all right okay so

3590
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:56,079
um so yep um i can go next

3591
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,239
so i think before talking about summer

3592
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:58,800
network and polkadot network uh we have

3593
02:10:58,239 --> 02:11:02,000
to

3594
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:04,079
make lococo network stable so

3595
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,119
they are auto program on the local

3596
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:07,520
testnet so

3597
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:09,040
we're gonna do our best to serve them

3598
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,400
with party technologies and website

3599
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:13,119
recommendations

3600
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:14,800
and if i understand correctly the common

3601
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:15,679
with the power chain will be connected

3602
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:18,000
first

3603
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:20,079
so probably program btc will be

3604
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,960
connected first or something like that

3605
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:25,040
then the projection will be happening so

3606
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:26,400
yeah what we have to do is to make

3607
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,719
rococo stable

3608
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:31,360
with the foundation quality technologies

3609
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:34,960
and all the community members

3610
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:36,960
okay um okay so still some development

3611
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,560
before you're you're ready you're ready

3612
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:41,840
to go okay

3613
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:45,280
um okay and then finally hang

3614
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:47,280
on right yeah in the past we have spent

3615
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:50,800
a lot of time like designing the

3616
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:51,360
token economy to uh be compatible with

3617
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,760
the

3618
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:54,719
slot auction so actually this is the

3619
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,079
most

3620
02:11:54,719 --> 02:12:00,159
complicated part i think in terms of the

3621
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:02,159
i mean compared with the technology

3622
02:12:00,159 --> 02:12:05,679
maybe the economy

3623
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:08,079
is even more complicated but of course

3624
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,840
in terms of the technology uh i think

3625
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:10,560
there are still something we need to

3626
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,880
prepare

3627
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:15,040
and as at the same time i think uh

3628
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,679
parity is still is still working very

3629
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:19,119
hard

3630
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:21,679
to fill the last last few things

3631
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:22,159
so for example like the stability so

3632
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:24,800
written

3633
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:25,360
recently we're experiencing experiencing

3634
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:28,960
some

3635
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:32,639
uh small problems so maybe in the next

3636
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:34,719
week or so local could be reset and then

3637
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,760
i think it will be much better and we

3638
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,079
already seen

3639
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,440
in this iteration is already much better

3640
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:41,760
than the first uh

3641
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:43,520
logo covey one now it's the second

3642
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,440
generation logo kobe one

3643
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,840
yeah and of course another thing is

3644
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,679
related to the

3645
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:50,079
performance and actually i think this is

3646
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:52,639
uh

3647
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:53,520
especially important for us uh in the

3648
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:56,000
last

3649
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,040
months we didn't test that it's just a

3650
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,079
standalone

3651
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:03,679
uh substrate blockchain and uh

3652
02:13:00,079 --> 02:13:07,040
in the testnet because our uh special uh

3653
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:09,760
uh topology and and and the design

3654
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:10,639
we have uh like more than two million

3655
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,760
transactions

3656
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:17,280
per uh in that month so it means that

3657
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:20,719
if we switch to a power chain uh

3658
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:21,440
and i i i expect it will have some

3659
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:24,239
influence

3660
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:24,800
in terms of in terms of the performance

3661
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:27,199
yeah and

3662
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,040
uh the the last one i think is the

3663
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:32,159
accessibility now

3664
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:32,719
i i think uh it's almost the the per

3665
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:35,119
chance

3666
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:37,920
architecture is almost ready but we

3667
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:40,239
still cannot access the data from the

3668
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,079
relation but and and this is already

3669
02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:43,840
planned and i think it will be very

3670
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:45,280
important for us to build a fully

3671
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:48,719
decentralized

3672
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:52,000
like the incentive for the slot auction

3673
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:56,079
is it will take use of this feature

3674
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:00,320
yeah okay um

3675
02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:02,400
so okay so you you all are building uh

3676
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:04,400
are part of the infrastructure to enable

3677
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:08,320
different dabs uh to come

3678
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:11,440
live on on polka dot um so

3679
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:13,679
just stepping back a little bit

3680
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:15,520
why should developers be building on

3681
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:16,719
polka dot in the first place like what

3682
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:19,920
are the advantages

3683
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:22,880
that uh this um this

3684
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,679
uh chain and i guess ecosystem of of

3685
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,159
chains

3686
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:28,400
provides that other other layer ones

3687
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,400
don't

3688
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:32,159
i can jump in on that um for some first

3689
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:34,400
thoughts that uh

3690
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:35,679
i mean i think what we're seeing is um

3691
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:37,520
you know obviously

3692
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:38,719
almost all the existing activities on

3693
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:40,400
ethereum so that's kind of

3694
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:42,320
where most of the existing developer

3695
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:44,000
activity is uh but there's definitely

3696
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:44,639
kind of a push and a pull going on right

3697
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,079
so the

3698
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:48,079
the push as was mentioned you know by

3699
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:51,040
some of the previous panelists is

3700
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:52,400
you know 100 transaction fees 300 you

3701
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:54,480
know d5 fees that

3702
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:55,840
i think makes people open-minded because

3703
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,639
there's certainly some users and use

3704
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,159
cases that

3705
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:59,920
are difficult to serve in that in that

3706
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:01,920
setting but the pull

3707
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,440
is that you know i think people are

3708
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:04,560
interested you know we're finding people

3709
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:05,920
to be quite interested in polka dot

3710
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:07,280
right i mean there's i think outside of

3711
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,040
ethereum it's

3712
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:11,360
you know it's definitely the place that

3713
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:12,800
has the most organic kind of developer

3714
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,079
activity going on like the

3715
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:16,239
you know i'll call it the richest kind

3716
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:17,280
of ecosystem so you know

3717
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:19,679
particularly a lot of the people we're

3718
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:21,119
working with um you know they want to be

3719
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:22,000
a first mover in this new and growing

3720
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:24,560
ecosystem they want

3721
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,760
to you know be able to service all these

3722
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,199
assets that are being created in this

3723
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:28,960
new ecosystem so i think

3724
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:30,320
that's the the pull part that it's you

3725
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,159
know is just as powerful

3726
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:34,079
that's causing you know causing uh you

3727
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:35,520
know people to kind of shift over to be

3728
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:38,800
looking very carefully to figure out

3729
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:41,199
figuring out their deployment plans um

3730
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,000
that's interesting because i i think the

3731
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:44,960
like the

3732
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,679
common argument for ethereum is it's

3733
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:47,440
community

3734
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:49,360
but you're saying that pogo that is

3735
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:52,639
creating its own kind of

3736
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:56,719
organic native community that is

3737
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:58,320
is also becoming kind of a moat for it

3738
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:59,679
i mean for my i mean maybe i'm a little

3739
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,000
biased because i'm not obviously in it

3740
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:02,079
but

3741
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,520
i mean i would say that uh it certainly

3742
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:05,040
has this kind of organic

3743
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,880
it has an ethereum-like feel i think in

3744
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:08,480
the sense that there's a lot of organic

3745
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,760
teams you know there's a lot of like

3746
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:11,199
it's not just kind of corporate it's

3747
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,920
like nights and weekends people that are

3748
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:13,520
just kind of

3749
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,719
building because they want to because

3750
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,440
it's fun i mean this is the kind of

3751
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:17,440
things that

3752
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:19,040
i think you don't see in a lot of other

3753
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:23,840
layer ones

3754
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:26,400
cool um um i like say doing that

3755
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,679
sure i mean i think i think like that

3756
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:30,079
summarizes up pretty well

3757
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:31,679
um from my like from from i've been

3758
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:33,359
doing a lot of research in this space

3759
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:35,040
for for some time now and i do think

3760
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:37,120
like the community on ethereum has been

3761
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:38,399
growing very fast and but it also had

3762
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:40,319
its start right you have to start

3763
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:41,439
somewhere and what i do see like working

3764
02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:42,880
with polka dot is

3765
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:44,639
that the community is growing very

3766
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:46,719
quickly and i think that there's been a

3767
02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:49,599
lot of effort to get people involved

3768
02:16:46,719 --> 02:16:52,399
to make it understandable and actually

3769
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:54,160
get people interested in the projects

3770
02:16:52,399 --> 02:16:55,439
i mean and i mean from our personal

3771
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:57,120
experience i mean we were super

3772
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:59,439
surprised i mean we've had like

3773
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:01,200
i think nearly eight and a half thousand

3774
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,120
people running our test net over like

3775
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,880
two and a half days i mean

3776
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,639
it's quite amazing that people actually

3777
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:08,559
are willing to go download like tech get

3778
02:17:06,639 --> 02:17:09,599
tested bitcoin and actually try them out

3779
02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:12,160
on polka dots

3780
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:14,000
um on testnet and i think that kind of

3781
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,359
speaks for itself so

3782
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,359
i do think that the community is super

3783
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,800
strong um

3784
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:20,559
it's taking a step back and looking at

3785
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:22,000
the general outlook i think

3786
02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:23,679
like if you look at the market right now

3787
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,280
i mean obviously ethereum fees are super

3788
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:27,280
high we've seen this before

3789
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,719
um but now you have alternatives right i

3790
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,280
mean you've seen what binance has been

3791
02:17:28,719 --> 02:17:31,200
doing

3792
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,120
very successfully in fact with pancake

3793
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,679
swap and alternatives

3794
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:38,000
um and then we have solana kind of also

3795
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:40,399
moving into the game with their own emm

3796
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,080
um but these chains i guess don't offer

3797
02:17:40,399 --> 02:17:43,679
you the same community and also like

3798
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:45,679
decentralization benefits

3799
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:46,719
so my feeling is that there is this

3800
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:48,080
moment right now

3801
02:17:46,719 --> 02:17:50,000
and it's not going to last forever when

3802
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:51,280
polkadot can actually deploy and move

3803
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,920
into the system

3804
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:55,040
and it will actually be able to gain a

3805
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:56,960
lot of traction

3806
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,800
but the moment obviously it's not going

3807
02:17:56,960 --> 02:18:01,519
to last forever so i do think that

3808
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:02,960
we have a limited amount of time to get

3809
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:05,200
everything running get the users

3810
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:07,120
um onto the system and show that it

3811
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,359
actually works and that it can compete

3812
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,120
um with centralized platforms perhaps

3813
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:13,519
even

3814
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:14,800
so it's interesting that right now i

3815
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:17,920
think

3816
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:21,040
we are at a very kind of

3817
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:24,080
special and con like a conductive moment

3818
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:27,040
into ethereum alternatives launching

3819
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:28,240
uh because of how high uh the fees are

3820
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:31,359
there and

3821
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:33,679
um you know it's it's like it's

3822
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:35,439
so many people are using ethereum that

3823
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:38,639
it's become unusable for

3824
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:41,439
uh at least part of of users

3825
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:42,960
so in that sense it seems like the the

3826
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:45,439
right moment for

3827
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:46,240
for ethereum alternatives to to launch

3828
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:49,599
um

3829
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:52,479
but uh but polka dot is still kind of

3830
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:53,200
almost there but but not yet so how do

3831
02:18:52,479 --> 02:18:56,240
you guys

3832
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:56,479
uh kind of manage that like how how do

3833
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:59,920
you

3834
02:18:56,479 --> 02:19:04,240
um kind of take advantage of this moment

3835
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:05,599
without being able to go actually live

3836
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:07,840
it must be must be a little bit

3837
02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:07,840
frustrating

3838
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:12,559
uh so i don't know

3839
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:17,920
this is tough question but um

3840
02:19:16,399 --> 02:19:20,479
you know the one of the great things of

3841
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:23,120
being community is the legit project

3842
02:19:20,479 --> 02:19:24,319
connected each other so i know derek and

3843
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,399
the alexay and ham

3844
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:28,080
for a while more than i think one or two

3845
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:32,000
years so

3846
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:33,200
yeah um so ecosystem is still too small

3847
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,920
to compete

3848
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:37,120
so we can bigger we can make it bigger

3849
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:40,160
together

3850
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:41,840
and the if i i would like to

3851
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:43,359
make polka dot much much bigger the

3852
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,920
ecosystem much much bigger with the

3853
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:46,000
community

3854
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:47,439
members as well as with foundation and

3855
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,240
party technologies

3856
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:51,920
so the good thing is we are still early

3857
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:54,720
stage so we can 100

3858
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:55,760
focus on technology rather than stupid

3859
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:58,800
marketing stuff

3860
02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:00,640
so this is our advantage i think and the

3861
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:03,359
technology make difference in the long

3862
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,720
run so that's why we should focus on the

3863
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:07,920
technology

3864
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:09,760
and the yeah uh polkadot has

3865
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:11,520
obviously advancing technology so we

3866
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:13,040
would like to catch up and we will drive

3867
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:16,720
to make it better

3868
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:18,240
and better together i don't know i i

3869
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:21,520
answered the question but um

3870
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:23,439
yeah this is my comments yeah no totally

3871
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:24,560
um hi do you have something to add about

3872
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:28,160
any of the two

3873
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:31,600
previous questions yeah uh

3874
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:34,160
can you hear i see it's uh okay okay

3875
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:36,640
yeah so uh actually i think uh polka dot

3876
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:39,760
is quite different from other projects

3877
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:42,560
like the other project is it's more like

3878
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,680
we want to make a platform and want

3879
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:47,359
everyone to move

3880
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:50,880
into this platform and this is it's it's

3881
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:53,760
it's may not be a good uh uh

3882
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:54,240
description but to me i think it's like

3883
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,840
a

3884
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:59,280
app store or play store so they want to

3885
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:01,760
build a barrier

3886
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:02,560
and and i don't like this feeling and

3887
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:05,359
polka dot is

3888
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:07,359
completely completely different because

3889
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:08,240
uh the team's building on polka dot is

3890
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:10,800
perfect

3891
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:13,040
and we can connect with each other and

3892
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:13,920
we offer our own capability to other

3893
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,960
blockchains

3894
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:17,680
and i think the interoperability is the

3895
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:20,640
core

3896
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:21,920
of uh polka dot ecosystem and at the

3897
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:25,040
same time i think

3898
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:28,319
this is the uh this is

3899
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:31,359
the the only uh unique

3900
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,920
uh feature offered by polka dot so uh to

3901
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:36,399
me i

3902
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:38,160
i think this is also the the biggest

3903
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:40,640
reason we want to build on polka dot

3904
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:41,280
rather than other protocols yeah so i i

3905
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,760
think uh

3906
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:44,479
so far although power change is not

3907
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:47,520
launched

3908
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:48,640
and we have uh actually we have more

3909
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:51,200
time to develop

3910
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:52,880
focus on the on the development just as

3911
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:55,680
i said by sota

3912
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,160
but i i expect once polka dot is

3913
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:58,800
launched

3914
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:59,359
it will be huge because we can do a lot

3915
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:02,080
of things

3916
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:02,479
that has never it was never possible in

3917
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:06,399
the

3918
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:08,479
in the in the past can you go

3919
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:10,080
deeper on that like and same question

3920
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:11,760
goes for for everyone else

3921
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:14,399
what are some of the things that you

3922
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:16,000
expect uh to build on polka dot that

3923
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:19,200
just weren't possible before

3924
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,160
on other chains yeah um

3925
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:23,280
i think the one of the most interesting

3926
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:26,160
use case will be

3927
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,720
dex decentralized expansion so let's say

3928
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,200
if i developed x on the top of e syria

3929
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:32,000
we can

3930
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:32,880
you know exchange not only erc20 token

3931
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,439
and these

3932
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:36,479
so if you develop you know decks on the

3933
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:38,240
top of alcohol

3934
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:39,680
since a lot of blockchain will be

3935
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:42,319
connected we can

3936
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:43,680
we can exchange bitcoin to ethereum

3937
02:22:42,319 --> 02:22:46,880
virgin is talking to passion

3938
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,160
tokens so um you know so this is gonna

3939
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:51,680
be huge

3940
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:55,120
i think this is you know very easy

3941
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:56,880
use case on the top of all that

3942
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:58,399
i'll chime in here that you know it's a

3943
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,840
little bit of a riff on one of the ideas

3944
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,800
that came up earlier that um you know

3945
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,840
kind of the why

3946
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:04,080
you know what is it that's different

3947
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,359
about polka dot and you know i think

3948
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,720
community is part of it but you know

3949
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:08,319
there's this kind of i've been thinking

3950
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:10,640
about this lately there's this

3951
02:23:08,319 --> 02:23:11,680
uh this idea um called conway's law

3952
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:13,200
right that there's this kind of

3953
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:15,439
connection between

3954
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:17,359
the structure of the architecture of

3955
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:19,680
software and the organization

3956
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:21,040
that like use it or build it and this is

3957
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,000
something i think is quite unique about

3958
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,840
polkadot where

3959
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,200
i mean every blockchain you know you're

3960
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:26,640
kind of creating this community and you

3961
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,920
get this emergent phenomenon of

3962
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:30,000
something that emerges that's

3963
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:31,520
kind of greater than some of its parts

3964
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,640
but you know in poconos almost like the

3965
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:34,319
super structure right i've seen i've

3966
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:35,280
heard people say it's a layer zero or

3967
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:36,319
it's you know they're using this

3968
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,680
different terminology it's a little bit

3969
02:23:36,319 --> 02:23:38,880
hard to understand but it is kind of

3970
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:41,120
this idea where

3971
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:42,479
each of us here on the screen each have

3972
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:44,640
our own project that are doing that

3973
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:46,240
but then we're all kind of together then

3974
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,359
building some like larger thing right it

3975
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:48,319
feels like you're part of something

3976
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,760
larger

3977
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:51,920
so i do think that that's something

3978
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:54,800
that's you know that is

3979
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:56,160
is unique here and um that's like one of

3980
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:57,920
the powerful ideas that i think

3981
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,200
helps organize like the community you

3982
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:00,319
know in a way that

3983
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,760
is different it's like the structure of

3984
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:03,280
the software lends itself to this

3985
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:05,280
organization of the community

3986
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:08,000
in a way that maybe isn't the case with

3987
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:08,000
other platforms

3988
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:11,920
yeah i think that's that's always the

3989
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:14,399
case when when just

3990
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:15,840
starting something out and being there

3991
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:18,479
first i think it's it

3992
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,520
must be super exciting for uh adapt

3993
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:22,640
developers

3994
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:24,880
um alex i don't know if you had

3995
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,080
something said about the previous

3996
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:28,160
questions

3997
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:29,120
sure i mean i guess like i mean it's a

3998
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,640
tough question right

3999
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:32,000
like what makes polka dots special what

4000
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:33,200
can we build we cannot build on a few

4001
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,800
other chains and

4002
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,960
i mean i think it's it's it's a tough

4003
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,479
one and i think also it's probably not

4004
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:39,520
exactly the question we should be asking

4005
02:24:38,479 --> 02:24:41,359
ourselves um

4006
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:42,560
it's not about the applications but on

4007
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:44,720
the technological side

4008
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:47,120
it's like the main benefit of polkadot

4009
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:48,399
is that you can customize your execution

4010
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:50,319
now we can we'll be able to build the

4011
02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:51,600
same applications like dexa is like on

4012
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:53,439
ethereum and

4013
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,800
um i mean emm is definitely a zero to

4014
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:56,720
one invention but

4015
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:58,080
i mean potentially you cannot move

4016
02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,880
towards more

4017
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:02,399
traditional um models which have less

4018
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:03,359
problems like avoid the permanent loss

4019
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:04,880
for example or even

4020
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,200
manage to build some form of order book

4021
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:10,399
system on top of polka

4022
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:12,080
but then again it's it's it's a very

4023
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:13,920
tough question to answer and predict um

4024
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:15,680
what we can see right now for example is

4025
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:17,120
that when building new applications

4026
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,800
you have much more flexibility i mean

4027
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:20,800
from our example we were able to build

4028
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:23,840
an on-chain key derivation mechanism

4029
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:25,280
um to derive um bitcoin addresses

4030
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:27,280
essentially what your wallets typically

4031
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:29,120
would do off chain on polkadot on chain

4032
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:30,800
this is impossible on ethereum the costs

4033
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:32,960
of doing optical operations

4034
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:34,240
on the vm are way too high and you kill

4035
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:35,840
the application

4036
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:37,359
but we can now actually say okay we're

4037
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:40,479
not going to optimize

4038
02:25:37,359 --> 02:25:41,840
each line of code at the cost of

4039
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:43,120
usability we can actually

4040
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:45,040
make sure that the users have a better

4041
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:46,960
experience and still not

4042
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,640
actually like slow down the entire

4043
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:50,080
system and make the application unusable

4044
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:50,720
because the performance bottlenecks so i

4045
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:52,800
think

4046
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:54,479
that's at the moment i think the largest

4047
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:55,920
benefit you can customize what you're

4048
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:57,439
building you can optimize for the

4049
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,800
specific thing that you want

4050
02:25:57,439 --> 02:26:00,560
rather than having to work with this

4051
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:03,359
universal toolkit which i think

4052
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:04,880
like dvm is is a brilliant thing that we

4053
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:05,600
had and we still have i mean a lot of

4054
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:07,600
projects

4055
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,520
are deploying evms on top of their power

4056
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:10,880
chains because it is so easy for

4057
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:13,200
developers to get it

4058
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:14,560
to actually to build on the system but

4059
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:15,680
if you want to dig in deeper if you

4060
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:17,120
actually want to build something more

4061
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:18,640
complex

4062
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,080
i think that's when you actually will

4063
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:21,439
want to go for power chain and then of

4064
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:22,800
course you have the argument for rust

4065
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:26,000
and wasm over

4066
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:26,640
um solidity and the vm in the long term

4067
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,160
but

4068
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:29,920
that's that's i think a bet people will

4069
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:33,040
have to take right

4070
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:36,560
yeah so there's a kind of the

4071
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:39,600
um over lying

4072
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:40,960
over like the broad theme um i've heard

4073
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:43,760
today is

4074
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:44,080
how specialization will will win in the

4075
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:46,880
end

4076
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:48,720
and people will want kind of these um

4077
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:50,399
more uh

4078
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:52,160
these kind of blockchains that you can

4079
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:55,439
modify to your own

4080
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:58,319
projects uh features and and needs so

4081
02:26:55,439 --> 02:26:59,680
um yeah definitely will be interesting

4082
02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:01,439
to see how that develops and

4083
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:02,960
let's say i just had a specific question

4084
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:06,399
on on the bitcoin

4085
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:10,160
uh bridge because i think kind of the

4086
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:13,680
the main um issue with these bridges are

4087
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:16,720
how they need to trust um

4088
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:17,359
uh who who is controlling the assets in

4089
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:20,000
the bridge

4090
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:21,359
so just wanted to to clarify that with

4091
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,359
interlake how

4092
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:24,800
uh what what level of control does the

4093
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:27,359
team have over

4094
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,200
uh the assets being held on the bridge

4095
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,240
on like bitcoin being transferred to the

4096
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,479
bridge

4097
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:34,880
but we don't have any control at all um

4098
02:27:32,479 --> 02:27:36,720
so like exclaim is a is a paper that we

4099
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:38,080
released in 2018 it's actually been peer

4100
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:40,319
reviewed and accepted at a

4101
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:42,080
conference and the main contribution was

4102
02:27:40,319 --> 02:27:44,000
that anyone can run only one of these

4103
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:46,479
vaults if they put down collateral

4104
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,160
so users have to guarantee that if

4105
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:50,000
someone misbehaves they'll get

4106
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:51,359
at least they will kind of have some

4107
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,920
financial guarantees that they won't

4108
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:53,920
lose

4109
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:55,760
from the economic perspective in chile

4110
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:57,520
as a team okay we might run one of these

4111
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:59,120
vaults but so can anybody else there is

4112
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,120
no restrictions you don't have to buy

4113
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:03,040
any tokens to participate

4114
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:05,040
and as for the perch in itself it will

4115
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,080
be running under polka dots governance

4116
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,920
mechanics

4117
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:09,520
um i can't say too much at this stage

4118
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,760
but we are going for one

4119
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:13,520
we are actually looking to make this a

4120
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:15,680
system that's available for common good

4121
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,920
without going into more detail there

4122
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,520
so intelli won't have full control over

4123
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:21,200
this and it's that's not our vision and

4124
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,120
we don't want to have control over it

4125
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,240
so that year is to have a decentralized

4126
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:26,160
from the start

4127
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:27,680
and what i can say like we will never be

4128
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:28,800
able to steal any uses funds and we

4129
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:30,720
never want to be able

4130
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:32,080
even to like even tell the possibility

4131
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:35,600
of doing that

4132
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:37,359
okay so anyone can can control vaults

4133
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:39,280
and one what's the incentive for

4134
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:41,359
controlling vaults

4135
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,359
so right now basically i mean you earn

4136
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:45,439
um fees of the total volume

4137
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:46,880
that goes to the power chain and then

4138
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:48,800
there will be models

4139
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:50,560
for additional incentives for vaults in

4140
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:52,880
collaboration with polka dots

4141
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:54,000
plus of course taking derivatives are a

4142
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:55,120
very interesting aspect

4143
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,280
aspect that we're exploring at the

4144
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,880
moment um so you will look so

4145
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,319
essentially what's going to most likely

4146
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:02,720
happen is you'll be able to reuse the

4147
02:29:00,319 --> 02:29:04,160
collateral that you put down as a vault

4148
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:05,840
either freely change taking for

4149
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:08,000
parachuting auctions or other

4150
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,920
mechanisms and you'll essentially have

4151
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,880
exposure to different apis so the

4152
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:13,280
additive

4153
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:15,120
you contribute to the polka dots and

4154
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:18,240
also poke ability at the same time

4155
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:20,319
okay so so people can stake right now

4156
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:22,319
so i mean right now you can run a vault

4157
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:24,000
you can it's on beta volts are open

4158
02:29:22,319 --> 02:29:26,319
source you can go and register the vault

4159
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,680
request dot test and dot from from the

4160
02:29:26,319 --> 02:29:29,200
faucet and you're good to go

4161
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:31,120
i mean of course it's still in beta so

4162
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:32,880
it's all it doesn't have economic value

4163
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:34,160
um but we're really looking forward to

4164
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:37,439
getting this um

4165
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:39,359
up to speed on christmas as well

4166
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:40,560
and then i had a specific question on on

4167
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:43,439
fala too the

4168
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:44,720
privacy network um i think i i got kind

4169
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:47,120
of a little bit lost in

4170
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:48,319
in the presentation and was wondering

4171
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,280
for the user

4172
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:52,479
um to to have uh like private

4173
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,920
transactions and

4174
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:55,920
interactions with different different

4175
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:59,760
apps is having a

4176
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:02,479
uh fala based wallet uh

4177
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,120
basically what what like the the thing

4178
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:04,960
that you need

4179
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:06,399
to have private transactions or is there

4180
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:09,920
an additional step

4181
02:30:06,399 --> 02:30:10,960
that you need to do yeah uh of course

4182
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,520
there are there are

4183
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:14,399
some problems if you don't have a

4184
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:17,760
special

4185
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:20,319
kind of wallet because like if you uh

4186
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:21,200
interact with some uh powertrain

4187
02:30:20,319 --> 02:30:24,160
directly

4188
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,479
you you write creators transactions sign

4189
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:27,280
it

4190
02:30:24,479 --> 02:30:27,920
and and broadcast it to the person and

4191
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:30,240
that's all

4192
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,160
but for us uh because we want to

4193
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:35,040
maintain the confidentiality

4194
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:37,520
so at least before you submit something

4195
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:40,160
to our blockchain you need to encrypt it

4196
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:40,960
and before you encrypt it you need a you

4197
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:44,160
need a key

4198
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:47,760
right so the key is uh it is made

4199
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:50,560
from some key uh uh key agreement

4200
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:52,880
uh protocol between the user between the

4201
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:56,319
end user and the secure enclave

4202
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:57,359
so uh in this uh uh if in this

4203
02:30:56,319 --> 02:31:00,560
perspective

4204
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:03,439
and that the answer is yes so uh

4205
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:04,000
if any protocol wants to interact with

4206
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:07,600
us

4207
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,520
at least uh their user side will need to

4208
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:12,720
integrate with our sdk

4209
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:16,640
but uh uh we have two ways to

4210
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:19,520
uh to inter interact with the different

4211
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:20,080
power change uh the one way is like you

4212
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:22,880
can use

4213
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:25,200
xcm to send some message but maybe the

4214
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:28,319
content of the message is already

4215
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:29,359
end to end encrypted and it is done by

4216
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:32,720
some sdk

4217
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:33,520
in like user's wallet or browser another

4218
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:36,640
way is that

4219
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:37,359
if uh some some data is already on file

4220
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:39,439
a network

4221
02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:40,560
and user can interact with fellow

4222
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,600
network direct

4223
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:45,200
directly so in this way actually they

4224
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:47,600
talk to the secure enclave

4225
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:49,359
rather than the our blockchain we

4226
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:50,399
separate the consensus and the

4227
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:52,960
computation

4228
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:53,600
so uh everything happens off the

4229
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:55,520
blockchain

4230
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:57,280
and it can make the performance even

4231
02:31:55,520 --> 02:32:00,640
better

4232
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:04,399
okay got it and then um questions for

4233
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:06,160
for sota and and derek um

4234
02:32:04,399 --> 02:32:08,560
so you're you're providing uh like

4235
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:11,200
platforms for for adapts to

4236
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,479
to build uh on on polka dot and you

4237
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:15,439
already have like some

4238
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:16,000
already some uh some teams building

4239
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:19,040
there

4240
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:22,080
so uh curious what

4241
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:23,840
what are the next uh projects

4242
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,760
either like whether they're ethereum

4243
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,560
based or or new projects

4244
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:28,880
that you are seeing uh coming to your

4245
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,720
your

4246
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:32,880
your platforms like what do you think

4247
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:34,160
will be the first steps to come live on

4248
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:36,840
polka dot

4249
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:39,680
whoever soda do you want to go first go

4250
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:42,800
ahead yeah um

4251
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:46,240
so i think this is great question in the

4252
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:46,640
actually the yeah while the frequently

4253
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:48,399
asked

4254
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:50,240
question from investor is what is the

4255
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:51,680
difference from between movie and

4256
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:54,080
problem so

4257
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:55,520
yeah but uh ecosystem is still too small

4258
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,560
to compete so we can be gathered

4259
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,680
together

4260
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:02,720
so yeah i respect what derek is doing

4261
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:04,479
in that system and the yeah in terms of

4262
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,560
the collaboration and the announcement

4263
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:08,080
we decided not to announce the

4264
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:09,359
partnership and the collaboration

4265
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:12,720
without code

4266
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:15,120
without demo and without you know movp

4267
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:17,439
minimum valuable product and the we have

4268
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:18,720
a you know some upcoming collaboration

4269
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:22,399
and partnership

4270
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:23,680
and the yes some yeah some project i

4271
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:26,160
i don't want to disclose some of the

4272
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:28,000
project but one project i can describe

4273
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,640
with microsoft so we are talking with

4274
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,160
microsoft

4275
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:34,960
japan and it will be disclosed very soon

4276
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,800
and what what's microsoft doing yeah

4277
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:38,640
they are providing infrastructure for

4278
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:41,359
the plaza network

4279
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:42,720
in the they're yeah we are doing

4280
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:46,080
together to make the

4281
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:47,840
the the node service then anyone can

4282
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:49,520
deploy body data on the top of the

4283
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:52,080
network

4284
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:53,359
this is not a task but uh right you know

4285
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:56,399
important function

4286
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:59,040
in the community oh interesting okay

4287
02:33:56,399 --> 02:34:00,319
um so okay so you work with microsoft

4288
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:03,359
for microsoft to

4289
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:08,640
help run the uh

4290
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:08,640
you set the notes on by by using azure

4291
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:13,200
okay and any depth you can disclose or

4292
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:14,960
or i guess like sectors like

4293
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:17,840
i don't know you can say like a lending

4294
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,840
protocol yeah

4295
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:26,240
okay so secret

4296
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:27,920
all right okay um derek

4297
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:30,000
and by the way like super interesting to

4298
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:32,560
see um sushi swap

4299
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,439
and balance are already uh building on

4300
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:36,160
on moon beams

4301
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:36,880
so what what else can we expect yeah i

4302
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,160
mean i'll just

4303
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:40,720
uh you know there's a lot of individual

4304
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:42,080
projects but if i just uh talk broadly i

4305
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:43,040
would say that you know it's certainly

4306
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:45,439
the case that

4307
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,319
d5 like the d5 sector is like where we

4308
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:48,240
we found the most

4309
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:50,240
traction and just to step back i mean

4310
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:52,640
our strategy is basically to

4311
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,840
approach ethereum based projects um as

4312
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:56,160
natural partners because

4313
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,600
given our ethereum compatible approach

4314
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:59,200
you know there's kind of minimal change

4315
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:00,560
needed on their end to be able to

4316
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,399
deploy the moon beam and then in doing

4317
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:04,240
so have a pokedex deployment

4318
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:07,120
but certainly defy i'd say they're the

4319
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:09,280
most uh aggressive to adopt i think

4320
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:10,319
and one of the reasons i think is that

4321
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,560
they

4322
02:35:10,319 --> 02:35:13,840
you know when it comes to these ux you

4323
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:15,040
know kind of concerns that alexa was

4324
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:16,240
talking about i feel like a lot of the

4325
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:18,080
d5 people actually

4326
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:19,760
don't care as much about that uh their

4327
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:21,760
users are like power users and

4328
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:23,359
you know they can be pretty big

4329
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:24,560
obstacles and people kind of like plow

4330
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,080
through right you know

4331
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:28,479
i think that uh that's kind of like you

4332
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,840
know they're they're definitely like um

4333
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:31,040
you know they're the place where we got

4334
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:32,560
the first option although i will say

4335
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:34,720
that i'm pretty bullish on

4336
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:36,640
uh the nft sector as well so i think

4337
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,600
that this same kind of dynamic we talked

4338
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:39,520
about before

4339
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:41,280
is certainly affecting you know nft

4340
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:42,080
based projects on ethereum where you

4341
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,920
know you have a hundred dollar

4342
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:45,920
transaction fee what does that mean for

4343
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,359
nft assets that cost less than a hundred

4344
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:48,720
dollars i mean they're right they're a

4345
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:50,479
little bit stranded so

4346
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:52,080
i think that you know and what one

4347
02:35:50,479 --> 02:35:53,680
pattern that we've seen is that

4348
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:55,120
you know minimum people want you know to

4349
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:56,880
potentially have multiple

4350
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:59,040
back ends where they can mint these

4351
02:35:56,880 --> 02:36:00,479
things and then you even offer the user

4352
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:01,760
a choice right to say well where do you

4353
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:03,040
want to create this thing and maybe

4354
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:04,640
there's some trade-offs to be considered

4355
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,600
like you know it's expensive on ethereum

4356
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:07,680
but maybe

4357
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:09,680
you know there's more potential you know

4358
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,120
buyers and other nft compatible systems

4359
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:13,040
or but maybe you want

4360
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,640
uh you know uh for a less expensive one

4361
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:16,000
it makes more sense to go to a place

4362
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:18,160
where it's going to be cheaper to mint

4363
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,319
and obviously you know that may make

4364
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:22,319
sense for other use cases

4365
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:23,840
yeah and here um i would like to talk

4366
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:26,319
about nfc as well

4367
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:27,760
so uh luckily i'm japanese even though

4368
02:36:26,319 --> 02:36:29,520
i'm in singapore so

4369
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,359
uh you know we have a lot of content

4370
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:34,240
such as manga anime

4371
02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:35,600
and so we are talking with our auto nft

4372
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:37,359
project in japan

4373
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:38,880
in these they are interested in the

4374
02:36:37,359 --> 02:36:42,479
polkadot system

4375
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:45,280
to to deploy anything in this case

4376
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:47,359
i think yeah like manga and nfts make it

4377
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:49,840
are like a dream combination

4378
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:51,680
yeah yeah i think so yeah it will be

4379
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:54,319
cool to see that on on pokedot

4380
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:55,920
um so uh we are running out of time i

4381
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:56,560
actually have to jump on something else

4382
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,240
that like

4383
02:36:56,560 --> 02:37:03,359
in five minutes so um i want to

4384
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:06,720
ask you a similar question to

4385
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:07,600
the the the last final just your longer

4386
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:09,680
term vision

4387
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:11,680
for uh for polka dot either you know

4388
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:14,720
defy on polka dot or just

4389
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:15,359
web 3 on on polka dot um where do you

4390
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:17,439
see it

4391
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:18,560
uh by the end of the year and where do

4392
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:22,000
you see it just

4393
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:22,000
you know 10 years from now

4394
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:26,000
i'll jump in i throw my head in the ring

4395
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:28,800
to start um i mean

4396
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
i think you know right now you know

4397
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,560
we're just seeing kind of this like

4398
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,240
straight

4399
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,160
porting action at least that's what

4400
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:36,000
we're seeing right so someone has an app

4401
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:37,359
it's fully working on ethereum they'd

4402
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,720
want to just port the whole thing

4403
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:40,479
you know to you know to something like

4404
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:43,600
moonbeam or possum

4405
02:37:40,479 --> 02:37:45,040
uh even so um that's kind of what i

4406
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:46,800
still consider to be a little bit like

4407
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:48,080
you know generation one you know kind of

4408
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:49,359
kind of architecture i mean

4409
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:51,439
the thing i'm probably most excited

4410
02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:52,960
about on polka dot comes from this like

4411
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,000
specialized you know specialized

4412
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:56,560
infrastructural

4413
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,439
chains right so i anticipate that

4414
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:59,840
there's going to be

4415
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:01,280
multi-chain based applications um you

4416
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:02,800
know that will use different

4417
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:04,800
specialized services just natively on

4418
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:05,840
polka dot and i think that's gonna you

4419
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,439
know those are gonna be the kind of apps

4420
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,960
that will really take advantage of

4421
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:10,640
you know this ability to have these like

4422
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:12,399
specialized like different services

4423
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,080
i think that's still you know relatively

4424
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:15,760
early and there's obviously these very

4425
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:17,280
well trodden kind of existing patterns

4426
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:19,280
that people are already used to but

4427
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:20,560
you know that's kind of what i see um

4428
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,920
you know that that's kind of what i see

4429
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:25,280
like moving forward that is

4430
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:28,960
i'm most excited about i'd say cool

4431
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:29,200
um alex you want to go um well i guess i

4432
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,760
mean

4433
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,560
end of the year will be live i mean

4434
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:34,399
that's definitely

4435
02:38:32,560 --> 02:38:36,000
i mean yeah there is no other there's an

4436
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:38,560
alternative let's put it this way

4437
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,200
um and in 10 years i mean i think like i

4438
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:41,920
i

4439
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:42,800
probably put my bet on poco essentially

4440
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:44,319
being this

4441
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:46,160
multi-chain infrastructure where you

4442
02:38:44,319 --> 02:38:47,200
have specialized chains and different

4443
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,600
applications

4444
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:50,800
um where it's moving away from this

4445
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:52,240
generalized kind of

4446
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:53,680
contract layers we'll have more and more

4447
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:56,080
people and more applications coming in

4448
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:58,000
building very dedicated services for

4449
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:58,479
example dexes which focus on the low

4450
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,560
level

4451
02:38:58,479 --> 02:39:02,319
basically optimize for high frequency

4452
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:05,439
trading and make sure that they

4453
02:39:02,319 --> 02:39:09,120
um can actually squeeze out the last bit

4454
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:13,920
out of like this execution models

4455
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:17,359
yeah and yeah yeah yeah um i can go next

4456
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:19,200
so i think um we have a very important

4457
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:21,120
role in the ecosystem

4458
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:23,120
in the actually i don't know the future

4459
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:24,160
we do not predict the future we make the

4460
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:26,000
future

4461
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,240
so we're gonna do our best to realize

4462
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,319
level 3.0 together with our ecosystem

4463
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:33,359
member

4464
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:36,640
sorry for the answer i

4465
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:39,359
love it i i think uh in the in

4466
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:40,800
like in the uh in the late this year i

4467
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:43,280
think d5 will also

4468
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:44,000
will still be the i think the most

4469
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,880
valuable

4470
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,240
uh use cases on polka dots as well as

4471
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:50,399
the other blockchains

4472
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:52,399
but in the long run i think in like 10

4473
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:56,080
years of course defy

4474
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:59,200
uh it's it targets the very high

4475
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:59,920
value users and very high value uh use

4476
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:03,120
cases

4477
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:06,720
but because of i i think because of

4478
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:08,560
uh the good architecture uh provided by

4479
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:11,920
polkadot and we can extend to

4480
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:14,800
multiple blockchains and it makes us

4481
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:16,560
it makes it possible to do computations

4482
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:18,240
on the blockchain and it

4483
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:20,160
maybe in the future will make it

4484
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:23,359
possible to store

4485
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:26,319
a big large amount of file

4486
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:28,479
uh in some kinds of uh decentralized

4487
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:29,040
network so if we combine them together

4488
02:40:28,479 --> 02:40:31,520
it means

4489
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:33,439
that maybe in the future the cloud

4490
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:34,080
computing will be fully decentralized

4491
02:40:33,439 --> 02:40:37,840
and i think

4492
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:40,560
this is uh i think it will be

4493
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:41,439
the next huge thing for blockchain yeah

4494
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:44,479
and

4495
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:45,120
this is how well this is the original

4496
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:48,160
version

4497
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:50,000
vision of web3 very cool

4498
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:51,840
okay so a decentralized feature an

4499
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,040
interconnected future

4500
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:56,720
a specialized feature and i i'm going to

4501
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:58,720
put that on a t-shirt we don't predict

4502
02:40:56,720 --> 02:41:02,000
the future we make it

4503
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:04,000
so very nice all right um so

4504
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:05,439
interesting chatting with all of you and

4505
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,479
um thanks for

4506
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:10,880
for inviting me um ashley

4507
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:12,000
if you're somewhere there um to moderate

4508
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:16,080
i i had a blast

4509
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,080
so hi everyone
