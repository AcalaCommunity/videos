00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
to add an account for the first time

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
sign in the middle of this circle

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,920
and we're going to see this 12 word

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,280
mnemonic seed the mnemonic seed can be

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
used to recover your account in case you

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,800
ever lose your device or

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
your computer but it can also be used by

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
anybody

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
to get full access to your account so

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
we're going to want to write it down and

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
save it in a safe place

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,600
steps

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,799
so now we have this screen uh we see

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
this drop down that says

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
allow use on any chain if we click it

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,560
we'll see a bunch of different

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
chains here if you're creating a polka

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,119
dot address you'd want to click polka

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
dot relay chain

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,479
and you'll see that the address in the

44
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
top just changed to the polka dot format

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
and if you're making kusama account you

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,119
want to click kusama relay chain

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
and you'll see that the address changes

48
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,079
again to the kusama format

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
today i'm going to make a polka dot

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,079
account now we're going to want to give

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,840
the account a descriptive name and call

52
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
it

53
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
my account now we want to give this

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
account a password

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
the password is what you're going to

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
need to input every single time you want

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,079
to use this account to make a

58
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,040
transaction

59
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
so you're going to want to make it

60
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
something that's secure but something

61
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,280
you're going to remember

62
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
so i'm going to put a password in right

63
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
now

64
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,719
and click add this account with the

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
generated seed

66
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
so now we see the account in our

67
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,759
extension with the polka dot flag up

68
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,399
here telling us that this is a polka dot

69
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
account

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,120
and the polka dot address so let's head

71
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,120
back over to polkadot.js.org

72
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
and click the apps wallet link

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
you'll notice that we got this

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
authorized page this will show up the

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
first time you ever go to a site that's

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
trying to request

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
access to your extension it gives you

78
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,040
information about what the site is what

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
the

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
url is and just giving you a fair

81
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
warning that you should

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,319
only approve applications that you are

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
familiar with and that you understand

84
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,760
it's a good idea to check the url that

85
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
it's showing you that the request is

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
from

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,599
to make sure it's actually the url that

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
you're expecting so

89
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,840

90
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,239
gonna click yes allow this application

91
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,280

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080

95
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
