1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,560
สวัสดีทุกคน ฉัน Dan Reecer จาก

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,639
Acala ตอนนี้ฉันเป็น VP of growth ที่นี่

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
ฉันอยู่ทีม Acala มาซัก

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,320
2-3 เดือน แต่ก่อนฉันใช้เวลาอยู่กับ

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
Web3 Foundation

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,080
ที่ฉันช่วยเปิดตัว polkadot และ

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Kusama วันนี้ฉันจะทำ

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,119
อย่างรวดเร็ว ฉันอาจจะพูดเร็วเพราะฉัน

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
พยายามจะให้อยู่ใน

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
หวังว่าซัก 5-7 นาที

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
ฉันจะพูดเกี่ยวกับ

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
การประมูล Polkadot และ Kusama parachain

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
และ crowd loan ซึ่งเป็นขบวนการ

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
ของการเปิดตัว

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
บล็อกเชนซึ่งเป็นหนึ่งในเครือข่ายของ

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
Polkadot และ Kusama อย่างที่คุณรู้ว่า

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
ระบบนิเวศ multi-chain นี้

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
กำลังพยายามเพื่อ

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
เป็นเครือข่าย blockchain ซึ่งถูกเรียกว่า

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
parachain

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
ในอนาคตจะขยายเพิ่ม

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
เป็น 100 parachain บน Polkadot และ

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,480
หนึ่งร้อย

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,480
ขึ้นไปบน Kusama แต่ว่าตอนนี้ยังไม่มี

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
parachain บนแต่ละอัน

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
ดังนั้นวันนี้ฉันจะพูดเกี่ยวกับ

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
วิธีการรับ slot

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,199
เหมือนกับหนึ่งในกรอบสี่เหลี่ยมตรงนี้ใน

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
ไดอะแกรม วิธีการเป็น

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
คนแรก

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,320
ที่ได้รับ parachain บน kusama หรือคนแรกที่ได้รับ parachain

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
บน Polkadot

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
และขบวนการของ crowdloan และ

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
กระประมูล parachain ดังนั้น

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
นี่คือไทม์ไลน์ คุณสามารถเห็น

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
crowdloan นั่น

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
มาก่อน ซึ่งเราจะเข้าไปใน ส่วนหลัก

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
ของอีเวนท์การประมูล parachain ตรงนี้ใน

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
กรอบสีขาว

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
นี่คือทีม parachain หลายรายการ

41
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
เป็นหลักการ bid ราคาแข่งกันระหว่างแต่ละอัน

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
เพื่อที่จะชนะประมูล

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,119
และผู้ชนะการประมูลจะได้ไปต่อ

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,240
และได้รับ slot

45
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
ตรงสีเขียวนี้ เมื่อคุณได้รับ slot แล้ว

46
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,000
คุณจะอยู่บน

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
Kusama หรือ Polkadot parachain อย่างเป็นทางการ

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
team and you can begin

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
launching your applications, applications

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
can build on you

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
and so on. This is ultimately the

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,240
vision of Polkadot and Kusama

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,399
and then the last part here you can see

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
there's an actual end time of this slot

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,560
that the team

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
earns so after the team earns that slot

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
then there's things that happen

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
including crowdloan funds being

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
returned

60
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
to the contributors and so on. And

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,439
I'll cover all that in the next few

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
slides.

63
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,439
So parachain auctions, I'm going to start

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
with, because you need to understand this

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,159
before we go into Crowdloans. So

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
a parachain slot auction is essentially

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,959
like I said

68
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,720
teams bidding against each other to try

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,720
to win one of these slots

70
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,440
each auction is ultimately going for

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
one slot it can be divided into smaller

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
chunks but ultimately

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
on Polkadot it can be up to 24 months

74
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
but some teams may decide to bid for

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,080
shorter but to keep this simple let's

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
just assume the maximum.

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Teams that are going into this

78
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
auction have two options for how to

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
actually

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
bid and what funds to use for their bid

81
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,640
so

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,879
first is if you have a single account

83
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
say for Kusama, you have a

84
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
stack of KSM that you want to use for

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
this auction

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
and you don't need to involve your

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,400
community then that could be one option.

88
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
The more frequent and more

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
likely scenario

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
will be number two here, which is using

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
the crowdloan module

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
so in this case you're actually

93
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
crowdsourcing KSM in the case of Kusama

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
or crowdsourcing DOT

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
from your community and you're

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,440
basically crowdsourcing this so that you

97
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,519
can use that

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,000
in the parachain slot auction.

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
How often will this happen? So

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
Parachain auctions will be done

101
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
one at a time but it's looking like

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
these will be about every two weeks so

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,720
these things will be happening on an

105
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
ongoing basis for the foreseeable future

106
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
so crowdloans first of all

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
like i said are used

108
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
for the opening bid in an auction so

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
teams will

110
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
crowdsource these tokens and then use

111
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
them in that parachain auction at the

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
next step.

113
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
If you're a user and you contribute KSM

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
to a Kusama parachain or if you

115
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,400
contribute DOT to a Polkadot parachain

116
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
you're essentially agreeing to locking

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
those tokens for the duration of that

118
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
parachain slot.

119
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
In the example that I used earlier

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
let's assume 24 months

121
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,720
then after 24 months your original

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,799
principle is returned back to you so

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
it's essentially no loss and a much more

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,200
ethical model

125
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
than we've seen in the past with things

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
like ICOs because in this case

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
you really hold the team accountable for

128
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
actually delivering on their

129
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,120
vision in their white paper because they

130
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
need to add value to their network

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
because they're actually not raising

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
any funds directly from you as the

133
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,160
community member.

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
Last, I kind of hinted at this

135
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
just now but

136
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
the funds that are contributed in

137
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
KSM or in DOT

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
are never touched by the team so there's

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
no worries about

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,440
teams raising money and running away

141
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
with it not delivering on what they

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
promised. All

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
the interests are really aligned here

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
and the team is really held accountable.

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
In the crowdloan,

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
this is kind of what it looks like.

147
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
You've got multiple teams

148
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
crowdsourcing KSM or DOT from their

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
communities

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
and that leads into the paratrain slot

151
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
auction.

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Everything that was raised in that

153
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,400
crowdloan stage is

154
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,320
is not accessible to the team but

155
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
they can actually use that

156
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
in their parachain slot auction. So you

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
can think of it like a poker table

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
at the beginning of the auction all

159
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
these teams will basically go all in

160
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,600
with the funds that they raised in

161
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,400
their crowdloan.

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Then how do we determine the winner?

163
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
When the auction starts we will know the

164
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
open time

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
here in the green, and we will know the

166
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,639
close time in the orange over here

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
and the most exciting point will be when

168
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,440
we hit this close time

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,759
the Kusama or Polkadot relay chain

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
itself will randomly select a time

171
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
that determines the end time, this red

172
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
bar here. So in this

173
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
example you've got Parachain B bidding,

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
Parachain C bidding,

175
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,479
Parachain A bidding.... E and F

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
beat A in terms of number of KSM but the

177
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,280
winner was determined at this red line

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
so

179
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
the highest bidder was Parachain A.

180
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
This is called an unpermissioned candle auction

181
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
and it incentivizes teams to bid

182
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
as high as they can as early as they can

183
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
instead of waiting until the end like

184
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
you might have seen on ebay

185
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,319
where people try to

186
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,240
snipe at the end and get the highest bid.

187
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
This is a full walkthrough of this

188
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
whole process. You've got

189
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
users over here contributing KSM they

190
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,720
contribute in this example to Karura

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,199
500,000 KSM. Then Karua

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
wins the first slot on Kusama and then

193
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,600
begins its launch process so

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
all of the KSM that was crowdsourced in

195
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
this original

196
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
crowdloan period is then locked in the

197
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,759
core

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,919
Kusama relay chain and then KAR

199
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
is then distributed, the native token of

200
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
Karura (KAR) is distributed to the

201
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
crowdloan contributors

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
and then at the same time

203
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
Karura is also launching so

204
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,039
the Karura stablecoin, the liquid KSM staking,

205
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
as well as

206
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,479
the Karura AMM-DEX, the Karura DEX

207
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
all go live on top of Karura

208
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
when this happens. At the end of

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,039
the parachain slot all of the KSM is

210
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,880
returned to the

211
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,400
supporters. Now the

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
last question that people sometimes

213
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
have is: 'What happens at the end of that

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
slot?' In this example, let's say

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
that it was a one-year parachain slot

216
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,479
the KSM is returned to the original

217
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
crowdloan supporters and then there's

218
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
three options for

219
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
any team to kind of maintain their

220
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
access to the relay chain.

221
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
First is to host another crowdloan and

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,680
do another parachain auction,

223
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
second is to self fund. Karura and

224
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
Acala will both have a decentralized

225
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
sovereign wealth fund

226
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
and over time that will

227
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
continue to build and build

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
so that we can become sovereign and

229
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
self-sustainable and actually

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,440
bid with our own treasury our own

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
sovereign wealth fund

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
for future slots, and then the third

233
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,800
option

234
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
there's probably several wiki articles

235
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
and videos that you could watch

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
about this but, the other option is

237
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
to become a parathread, which

238
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
just means that you have a little

239
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
bit less access..

240
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
less frequent access to the relay

241
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,039
chain itself.

242
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
So that's it in about eight minutes.

243
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
Hopefully you learned something. Let me

244
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,759
know if you have any questions.

245
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
Thank you, bye.
