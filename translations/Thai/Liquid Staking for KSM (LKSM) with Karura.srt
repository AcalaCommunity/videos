[เพลง]

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
ต่อไปเป็นเรื่องเกี่ยวกับการ staking

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,920
สภาพคล่อง และมันน่าที่งมาก

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
ฉันรอไม่ไหวที่จะใช้ฟีเจอร์นี้

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,960
การ staking สภาพคล่องสรุปโดย

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
พื้นฐานแล้ว

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,119
มันเป็นเรื่องของการ staking pool ที่ไม่จำเป็นต้องมีการเชื่อใจ

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
โดยคุณสามารถ

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
stack ทรัพสินย์ของคุณอย่างอิสระ

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
โดยถ้าคุณกำลังถือ Kusama วันนี้

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,519
และถ้าคุณเป็น validator (ผู้ตรวจสอบ) ซึ่ง

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
คุณควรจะ

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,279
ทุกๆครั้งที่คุณต้องการใช้จ่ายหรือคุณ

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,000
ต้องการย้าย Kusama ของคุณ โดย

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
ทั่วไป

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
จะมีระยะเวลาประมาณ 7 วัน

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
เพื่อความปลอดภัยของเครือข่าย

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
และบน Polkadot จะนานกว่า มัน

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
ใช้เวลา 28 วันสำหรับการเอาทรัพย์สินที่ stack ของคุณออก

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
โดยสิ่งที่เราสร้าง เราเรียกว่า

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
การ staking สภาพคล่องโดย

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,559
เป็น pool ที่ไม่จำเป็นต้องเชื่อใจกัน โดยคุณสามารถ

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,879
stake โดยใช้

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,559
karura และทุกๆครั้งที่คุณ stake คุณ

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,879
จะได้รับใบเสร็จ

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,600
ของทรัพย์สินที่คุณ stake เพราะว่ามัน

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,000
เป็นใบเสร็จแบบ

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
trustless ของสถานะทรัพสินย์ที่

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
พวกเราเรียก LKSM

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,079
โดย LKSM คือตัวประกันตราบเท่าที่คุณ

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,080
ถือ LKSM

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
คุณจะได้รับรางวัลของการ staking

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,439
มันปลอดภัยด้วย เพราะว่ามัน trustless

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
ซึ่งมันการันตีว่าคุณสามารถ

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
ถอน ksm

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
ได้มากขึ้น เมื่อคุณต้องการถอน ksm

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
กลับมา

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400
ดังนั้น นี่คือบางอย่างที่

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
ที่แบบ

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,439
ใช้ง่ายสุดๆ ฉันคิดว่าทุกคนควรจะ

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
ใช้มันถ้าคุณถือ

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,799
Kusama ฉันจะสาธิต

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
ให้ดู

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
สำหรับฉันที่มีลิสต์การ stake

45
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,720
เชื่อใจใน

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
trestles staking pool มันธรรมดา

47
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
ที่จะ swap

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
เหรียญ DOT หรือ KSM ไปเป็น LKSM พวกเราสร้าง

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
UI ดูเหมือนการ swapping

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
แต่ข้างในจริงๆแล้วไม่ใช่แต่เป็น

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
การ staking

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
ดังนั้นฉันจะพูดถึงมัน

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
และนี้

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,439
ฉันจะนำ หนึ่ง KSM ไป

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,360
แลกเปลี่ยน ฉันจะ

56
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,200
ฉันจะได้รับ 10 LKSM โอ้ไม่ดีเลย เรทนี้

57
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
ถูกกำหนดโดยระบบ

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,119
เรากำลังพัฒนา user

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,799
interface ทีหลังให้เป็น

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,200
หนึ่ง KSM จะเท่ากับ หนึ่ง LKSM

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,600
และ

62
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
หนึ่ง LKSM จะกลายเป็น มากกว่า

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Ksm เมื่อคุณถอนในภายหลัง

64
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
มันเหมือนกับว่าถ้าคุณถือ LKSM

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,679
มันจะโตขึ้นคล้ายๆกับวิธีที่คุณ

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,200
เก็บเงินและดอกเบี้ยจะทบต้นเงินคุณ

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
มันจะโตขึ้นแบบนั้นเหมือนกับคุณได้

68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
ดอกเบี้ย

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
แต่ในนี้ โดยเฉพาะในการ staking

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
สภาพคล่อง คุณจะได้รับรางวัล

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,319
การ staking

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,360
LKSM มาที่นี่อีกครั้ง ให้ฉัน

73
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,720
อธิบายในกรณีนี้คุณสามารถดูที่

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Dot และ Dot นี้

75
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
มันอาจจะง่ายกว่า สิ่งที่คุณ

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
กำลังทำอยู่ที่นี่ เมื่อคุณ staking Dot

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
โดย staking 10 dot คุณจะ

78
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
ได้รับ 10

79
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
และเปลี่ยนมันกลับไปเป็นสภาพคล่อง

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,879
dot สามารถใช้ใน

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
Acala แต่สิ่งที่ Ruitan พูดถึง

82
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,239
คือ

83
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
สิ่งนี้เป็นใบเสร็จรับเงินของคุณอย่างไร

84
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,319
your staked dot

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
ดังนั้นถ้าสิ่งที่คุณกำลังจินตนาการถึง

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,800
ฉากบนกระเป๋าที่

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
แสดงทุกสิ่งทุกอย่างของ

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
balances your l dot

89
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,879
balance will actually always be going up

90
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
because it's it's showing you it's a

91
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
receipt for your staked dot

92
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,040
so as your staked dot starts earning

93
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,080
more and more staking rewards that'll be

94
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,480
reflected in your ldot balance so when

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
you go to redeem your l dot

96
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,400
for like native dot at the end

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,440
whenever you want to unstake your l dot

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
will have gone up

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
since the moment you actually got your

100
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
original l dot if that makes sense

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,480
because it's just it's always reflecting

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,400
your staking rewards adding on to your

103
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,720
stack of ldap yeah think about as if

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
eldor is a share of the pool

105
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
of the sticking pool and the staking

106
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
pool is growing in size because there's

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,760
going to be staking reward that's

108
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
praying to the pool but you can always

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
redeem um for the same share that you

110
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,040
put it in

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
so your your that up the the redeeming

112
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,480
number will be always growing so holding

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,799
lg holding lksm is as if you are

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,840
staking yeah and it's slightly if you

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,680
have ldl

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
or you have lksm because we call it

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
liquid right it's actually transferable

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,439
within the archive shot and within the

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
wider pocket ecosystem

120
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
you can send ldot to someone else you

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,080
can send lksm to someone else

122
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
as he was just moving um as if he's just

123
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
moving some

124
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,200
of some some transferable assets um the

125
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,120
the recipient who gets

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,000
elder or google gets klks can choose to

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,400
continue to hold on the the lksm or l

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
dot

129
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,440
or they can continue to decide to redeem

130
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,520
um and get the actual valence dot back

131
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,960
so this is like the reason we call it

132
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
liquid is that it's transferable it

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,000
could be used for other utility as well

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,320
and one big utility that you can use

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
with this lksm is that you can actually

136
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,639
borrow

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,639
against your lksm and the demo that i

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
showed earlier is that you can borrow

139
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
against your stack asset

140
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,040
so you don't actually have to give up

141
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
the opportunity cost if you say that you

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,000
want to borrow against stocks

143
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
you have to choose that hey do i want to

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
select these stocks or do i want to

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
borrow against my dollar but with ldl

146
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,840
always lksm this is the best of both

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
it could be earning the staking reward

148
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
while you're borrowing against a

149
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,600
position

150
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,960
one question um from jack here in the

151
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
chat is

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
it's basically like what he said what

153
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,639
happens if you trade or sell your ldot

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,320
so you have like the stake

155
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,960
dot you get this l dot let's say you

156
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
sell it all and you have so what happens

157
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
then to your original dot like how do

158
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,680
you actually

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,720
either pay for that or get get the dot

160
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,639
so think about the aldol it's like an a

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
receipt or redeems the receipt for your

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
stakedown right so if you sell your l

163
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
dot you actually sell the right

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
to redeem those dots so it's as if you

165
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
sell the dot to someone else so

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
in the demo that i just showed earlier

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
if i transfer some elder to somewhere

168
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
else

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
i was transferring the the redeem right

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
of the underlying dot

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600
to someone else so it's as if i was

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,280
transcending dots so if you sew them

173
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
then you just like as you saw the dots

174
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,240
it's

175
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
um it's no longer yours and yeah the

176
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
redeem right for that

177
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,199
length is also no longer yours okay

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
so the the l dot isn't connected

179
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,479
directly to

180
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
like a specific dot it's kind of that

181
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,840
pool so if i

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
so if jack here who asked the question

183
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
sent me his l dot i could type that l

184
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,520
dot and redeem it for dot

185
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,440
in the akala pool yes yeah okay

186
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
yeah the moment that you the moment that

187
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
you stick with the the

188
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,479
um the liquid sticking pool um the dog

189
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
enter the pool

190
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,160
and you essentially get is that what you

191
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
essentially get back is the right to

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
redeem

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
for the dog and because thought itself

194
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,759
is not functional it's fungible like

195
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
every single dog is the same

196
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
you can't say that okay that dog is my

197
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
dog and that dog is your dog they are

198
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,600
all dots

199
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
yes this guy the sage law said so the

200
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
l-dot is like the title to a car

201
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,440
so if you sell the title someone else

202
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,360
kind of owns the car

203
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,240
yes since um another good question is

204
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
basically could you explain how the the

205
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
interest

206
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
or the staking interest works since

207
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,960
you're staking

208
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,240
with a kala versus i guess in the in

209
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
this case with kerra so if you're

210
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,199
staking your ksm with kura it's not

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
staking like

212
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
directly into the kusama chain there's

213
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
this there's this kind of application

214
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,919
layer so

215
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,599
they're asking who is paying that

216
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,720
percent interest for

217
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,160
um in the career case lksm staking like

218
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
how does that work

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
well awesome like this is a good

220
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,360
question right so the um

221
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
think about the um the liquid staking

222
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,680
pool as a trustless staking pool

223
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
the dot order the ksm that you deposit

224
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
into the pool will be managed by the

225
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
network and the

226
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
network will then nominate those dots

227
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
into the

228
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,599
um validator within the kusama network

229
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
and if this dot is

230
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,720
this full size is growing size it will

231
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,960
be managed it will be nominated across

232
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
multiple validators uh in the in the

233
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,280
kusama network

234
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
so ultimately the staking reward of the

235
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
of

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,680
staking by minting the lksm would be

237
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
equivalent to the average eu of the

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,479
network

239
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
it will be safer because like d2 is

240
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
spread across

241
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,639
multiple validators so even a slash

242
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
happens

243
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,240
the risk of like the pool is

244
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
sort of like meditated um because only

245
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
slash a proportion a tiny portion of

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
that

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
but the same um the sticking reward is

248
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,400
also the average yield

249
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
it's like a safe average view of the

250
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,520
expected return

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,280
of the network and one key other um

252
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,400
fact we need to understand is also the

253
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
l ksm holders actually uh can vote for

254
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,039
validators so this is what we are

255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
working progress so

256
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,400
when you meet lksm you get you have the

257
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,080
the right to say that i

258
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,959
prefer the pool to validate and delegate

259
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
the ksm into this set of validators and

260
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,080
ultimately

261
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
the pool will check all the input from

262
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
the lksm holders

263
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,880
and nominate those um those kikusama

264
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
for across all the validators as

265
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,800
proportion as a portion

266
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,959
with kusama now if you're staking

267
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,560
through polka dot js it's you as a user

268
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,279
staking directly to

269
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
a validator or a set of validators in

270
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
this case

271
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
in this case there's kirura in the

272
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
middle so you

273
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
stake with karua karua distributes the

274
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
stake of

275
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,959
everyone on karua to an evenly

276
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
distributed set of validators across

277
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,080
kusama and then all the returns coming

278
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
in from

279
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
those validators are pooled and then

280
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,640
evenly distributed at the average

281
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
across all the validators that carrera

282
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,720
is staking with

283
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,480
yes and if this is like a centralized

284
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
staking service then you have the risk

285
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
of

286
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
the centralized entity being default you

287
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
have this chart you have to trust the

288
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
centralized entity

289
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,560
um to do the right thing but since um

290
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,279
the liquid staking protocol that we

291
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
currently have

292
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,399
is trustless everything is managed on

293
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
chen

294
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,920
uh you can think of like it's like an

295
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
advanced version of smart contract

296
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
um everyone is staking in a trustless

297
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
way and there's no risk of

298
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
um of being um managed by one single

299
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,760
centralized entity

300
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,680
so this is the i think this is awesome

301
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,880
this is the way to go um for

302
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,880
um in a sense yokusama even you stick

303
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,920
through the liquid staking

304
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,399
the yokusama never leave your custody

305
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,560
okay so by staking or by making dot

306
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,519
liquid are we compromising the safety of

307
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,720
the polka dot

308
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,320
chain the dot can be slash uh still be

309
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,360
slashed right

310
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
um what happens then the

311
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,760
so basically he's asking what happens

312
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,440
with like network security and slashing

313
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
okay i think this is an awesome question

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
right so um if the

315
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,880
polka dots network security can be

316
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
compromised

317
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,800
by saying that you simply pull up the um

318
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
the dot together

319
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
and make it transferable and making

320
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
liquids

321
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
then i think it's going to happen anyway

322
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,959
like there's always

323
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
a lot of centralized entities so if you

324
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
stick with finance today

325
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,440
you can already transfer your stack

326
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
asset you can trade it in the market or

327
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
things like that

328
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
so the thing is that i we don't think

329
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,920
this is going to affect the um the

330
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,800
pokedex network security at all because

331
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
ultimately

332
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,399
if by simply reprogram or by gaming

333
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,680
by by building something on top of the

334
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
network and you can affect

335
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
security then there's actually a

336
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,800
security problem of the underlying layer

337
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
in this in our case we don't think

338
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
that's going to have any problem

339
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,519
um the other key stuff to think about if

340
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,760
you step

341
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
through this particular liquid staking

342
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,040
pool you

343
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
actually do not have the like the

344
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,640
risk-free way to say that you are no

345
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,160
longer getting chance of getting slashed

346
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,000
so if the liquor staking pool was

347
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,200
delegating or nominating

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,959
let's say across um 50

349
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
validators and one of those getting

350
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,399
slashed the pool actually will get a hit

351
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,279
of getting this slashed

352
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,160
but the the the result of like spreading

353
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
this pool

354
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
um across 50 validator is that even

355
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
though you you're getting slash in one

356
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
validator

357
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
the overall damage for the whole pool is

358
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
uh particularly low and that's why i say

359
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
it's a

360
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,279
safe way to stake it's getting the

361
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
average view of the network

362
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
it's not trying to seek for the maximum

363
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,000
return um

364
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,079
but it's also a very very user-friendly

365
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,639
way that you can always expect to earn

366
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
the expected return of the network

367
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
if you were stating by yourself and if

368
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
you're nominating your dot to one

369
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
particular

370
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
um validator and then if that validator

371
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
was misbehaving is slashed

372
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
then you will get a you will take a

373
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,000
touch by normally getting that validator

374
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,440
if you stick through this pool there's

375
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,079
still chances that value

376
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
gets less but the overall cost for the

377
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,279
pool holders

378
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,279
will be even out and will be reduced

379
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,480
one of the current issues on polka dot

380
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
and kusama right now

381
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
is are the there are two things the

382
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
staking minimums are

383
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
becoming super high on polka dot and

384
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,560
also on kusama

385
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,839
um so what this allows is

386
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,240
for people to come in and stake dot with

387
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
like virtually no minimum right like

388
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
what would the yes

389
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,040
what would the actual minimum be so this

390
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,440
is like um

391
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
i have friends that has like 40 dots

392
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
right and my friend really want to stake

393
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,839
but you can't because the minimum

394
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
staking amount on product

395
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,200
currently i think it's over 200 which is

396
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
um a lot

397
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
but in this if you stick through um kura

398
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
or if you stick through alcala

399
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,639
you actually can get you can actually

400
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,040
bypass this limitation

401
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,399
because like the pool itself like this

402
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,320
particular address uh

403
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,079
controlled by the protocol uh will

404
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,800
actually definitely have more than 200

405
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,399
dots to nominate so no matter how much

406
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,160
how how small amount you have you can

407
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,920
still deposit into this pool

408
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,160
and the pool by itself can nominate um

409
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,200
the total amount of its dollar to other

410
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,160
validators so yes

411
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,519
we can definitely bypass that and then

412
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
the other thing is

413
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
um people who are staking through polka

414
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,079
dot js

415
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,959
or um any of the other kind of

416
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
more native staking like not exchanges

417
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,680
and centralized stuff

418
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,680
with polka dot js right now you stake

419
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
ksm and you have to do this seven day

420
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
unbonding period

421
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,360
and then with polka dot it's even longer

422
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,880
it's 28 days so it just takes forever to

423
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,519
unlock

424
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
with uh with karua and with akala you

425
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
can

426
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
and we're talking maybe you can show

427
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,480
this but um

428
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,959
basically you can unstake early for a

429
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
small

430
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,519
fee yes so the design of the liquid

431
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
sticking pool is that if i go to the

432
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
advanced

433
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
tab you will see that we always have

434
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
some maintenance some free

435
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,600
dots or some free kusama available for

436
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
redeem immediately

437
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
so let's say that if an user we really

438
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,560
want to redeem

439
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,320
the l back to dots immediately you can

440
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,680
do so because there's always

441
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
a portion to set aside um for free um to

442
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
redeem

443
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
but if you want to redeem immediately

444
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,320
you need to pay a fee to cover the

445
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,519
otherwise lost return of those free

446
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
portion of the pool

447
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
um and also like this is not option this

448
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
is not compulsory so if you want to

449
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
redeem

450
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
there's actually three way for you to

451
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
redeem you can say that i want to redeem

452
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,480
now then i will so i will have to pay

453
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,800
some fee

454
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
all you said i was gonna redeem the

455
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,920
typical way

456
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
um that's like waiting for the standard

457
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,279
unbounding period

458
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,800
you can free to do so or you can also

459
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
redeem to say that i want to redeem and

460
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
there's

461
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,399
a cue of unbounding um dots on the

462
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,760
on the on the on the on the staking pool

463
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
because like will be always

464
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,279
rebalanced between the stick dots and on

465
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,959
an unstacked dot

466
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,720
so you can choose that which maybe like

467
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
five days later you need the dots that

468
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
would be at that particular price

469
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
so it's actually a lot of like advanced

470
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
feature hidden in here that you can

471
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,639
redeem

472
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480
in multiple way um you can redeem at no

473
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,920
cost or you can redeem immediately

474
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,880
so in that in the middle one that you

475
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
just showed um

476
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
basically the main difference would be

477
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,199
every

478
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,760
every day closer to the current date

479
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,600
you're just

480
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
paying a little bit higher of a fee is

481
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
that right yes yes

482
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,279
so thinking about that you want to

483
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
withdraw money from a fixed term deposit

484
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
account

485
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
right so you have to pay some fee or you

486
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
have to lose some interest if you want

487
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
to withdraw money from a fixed um

488
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,160
from a fixed um deposit account and how

489
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,639
much you want to

490
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,839
how urgently you need the money depend

491
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:53,600
and you'll forfeit

492
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:53,600
how much interest you'll be giving back
