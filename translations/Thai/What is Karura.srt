1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,160
สวัสดีทุกคน

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
ผม Dan Reeser จะมาร่วมพูดคุย

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
ที่นี กับ  Ruitao

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,599
วันนี้เราจะมาเจาะลึก

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
ข้อมูลกันสักหน่อย

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,640
เกี่ยวกับเครือข่ายของเรา Karura ที่

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,039
พวกเราพัฒนาบน kusama คุณอาจจะ

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
รู้จัก

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
พวกเราในชื่อของ ทีม acala พวกเรายัง

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,080
กำลังเตรียมสำหรับ

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
การใช้งาน acala บน polkadot อีกด้วย แต่มันจะ

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
เกิดขึ้นหลังจากเราได้เริ่มใข้งาน  Karura แล้ว วันนี้

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,960
เราจะใช้เวลากันสักหน่อย

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
ในการพูดคุยเกี่ยวกับสิ่งนั้น ให้ฉันเริ่ม

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
แชร์หน้าจอของฉัน

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
ฉันจะอธิบายสั้นๆ เกี่ยวกับ

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,320
วาระของเรา

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
เรามาเริ่มกันได้เลย

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
เช่นนั้น

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
วันนี้ฉันจะมาพูดบาง

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
สิ่งเกี่ยวกับ

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
Karura โดยทั่วไปคืออะไร ฉันจะอธิบาย

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
ด้วยสไลด์บางส่วนและให้คุณเข้าใจ

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,800
ภาพรวมของ

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
ทุกสิ่ง และ รู้จักผลิตภัณฑ์ ที่เรา

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,760
พัฒนา และผมจะพาไปคุยกับ Ruitao

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
ที่จะมา

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,199
สาธิตเกี่ยวกับ ผลิตภัณฑ์แต่ละชิ้น

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
ที๋โดดเด่นที่สุด

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,800
Ruitao จะเริ่มต้นด้วย กระเป๋า Wallet จากนั้น

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
เราจะมาอธิบายเหรียญ kusd ที่เป็น  Karura

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,120
ดอลล่า Stable coin

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
หลังจากนั้น เราจะพูดเกี่ยวกับ Karura AMM Dex

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
และจากนั้น

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,320
สุดท้าย เราจะจบด้วย Liquid KSM staking

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
ดังนั้น มันจะเจ๋งมากๆ ถ้า

37
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,360
สามารถทำให้มันเป็นจริงได้ และ

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
พวกคุณที่ได้เข้ามาร่วมและเห็นจริง ๆ

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
การทำงานของผลิตภัณฑ์จริงๆ

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
และ สิ่งที่เรากำลังจะทำ Robin อยู่กับเราที่นี่ด้วย

41
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,159
พวกเราจะ

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
วาง ลิ้งค์ของพวกเราไว้ท้ายสุด ที่คุณสามารถ

43
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,040
ใช้งานแอพลิเคชันเหล่านี้ได้จริงๆ

44
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,640
บน Testnet ได้ตอนนี้เลย

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,439
และเตรียมพร้อมสำหรับสิ่งที่กำลังจะเกิดขึ้น

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,119
บน kusama เร็วๆนี้

47
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
ดังนั้น ขั้นแรกเราจะขอ

48
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,040
แนะนำตัวเองก่อน และ หลังจากนั้น

49
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,119
เรามาเริ่มกันเลย

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
ขอบคุณมาก Dan สวัสดีทุกคน

51
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,960
ผม คือ Ruitao ผู้ร่วมก่อตั้ง

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
acala และ karura เช่นกัน

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,759
ทำงานเกี่ยวกับ Karura 

54
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
ผมทำงานทางด้านบล็อคเชนมา

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,240
มากกว่า 7ปี ผมจะบอกว่า

56
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,159
พวกเราเริ่มพัฒนาเครือข่าย acala

57
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
ย้อนกลับไปเมื่อสองปีที่แล้ว

58
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,920
พวกเรา คือ หนึ่งในกลุ่มแรกๆ

59
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,280
substrate builders ผมเป็น วิศวกร

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
จนถึงปัจจุบัน

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
จนถึงวันนี้ ผมรักการเขียนโค้ด และ

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
นั้นคือประวัติคร่าวๆ ของผมครับ

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
ฉันกำลังจะสร้าง

64
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
สิ่งล้ำสมัยและตื่นเต้นมากที่

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
หลังจากสร้างมาเกือบสองปี

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
เราใกล้จะเข้าสู่ช่วง Go live โปรเจ็คนี้แล้ว

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,200
บน kusama

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
เยี่ยมมาก ขอบคุณ Ruitao และผม Dan

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Reeser

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,959
รองประธานฝ่ายการเติบโต acala

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
และ karura

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,560
ผมอยู่ในทีมมาสักพัก

73
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
2-3 เดือนก่อนหน้านี้แล้ว

74
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
เคยทำงาน

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,239
นอกเวลา กับ acalaประมาณ

76
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,319
หก เดือนก่อนที่จะเข้าร่วมทำงานแบบเต็มเวลา

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
ก่อนมาทำงานที่ acala ผมใช้เวลาอยู่ที่

78
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,080
web3 foundation

79
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
ทำงานบน Polkadot และ Kusama ดังนั้น

80
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
ดังนั้นมันจึงเป็นการความก้าวหน้าทางธรรมชาติ

81
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
จากชั้น Layer นี้ขึ้นไป

82
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
หนึ่งขั้นจนถึงขั้น Parachain และ

83
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
เตรียมตัวให้พร้อม

84
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,239
ความบ้าคลั่งทั้งหมดนี้และ

85
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,760
ความตื่นเต้นที่

86
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,280
กำลังจะตามมาทั้งหมดนี้

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,920
การเปิดตัวครั้งแรกที่

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
เรา

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
เรากำลังดำเนินการอยู่นั้นคือ karura

90
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,599
และ ผมคิดว่าก่อนที่เราเข้าสู่

91
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
รายละเอียดของ

92
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,200
karura และ acala

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
มันมีประโยชน์ ที่เริ่มสม่ำเสมอ

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,560
ที่ขั้นสูงที่สุด สิ่งที่เรากำลัง

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
สร้าง

96
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,480
เป็นหนึ่งใน parachains เหล่านี้

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
ขนาดเล็ก เหมือน

98
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,560
gray squares นี่คือแต่ละคู่

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
เชนหรือแต่ละบล็อกเชน

100
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
ที่ถูกปรับแต่งเพื่อวัตถุประสงค์เฉพาะ

101
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,360
และสิ่งที่กราฟิคนี้แสดงให้เห็น

102
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
คืออนาคต ที่ซึ่ง

103
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
เราจะมี 100 หรือมากกว่าคู่ ที่

104
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,599
เชื่อมต่อกับเชน เข้ากับ kusama

105
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
และ 100 หรือ มากกว่า parachains เชื่อมต่อเข้ากับ

106
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,640
polkadot

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
ทั้งหมดในระบบนิเวศที่เชื่อมโยงกันเป็นหนึ่งเดียว

108
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
เพราะที่เห็น

109
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
ตรงกลางนี้จะมีสะพานเชื่อม (Bridge)

110
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
ระหว่าง polkadot และ kusama แต่

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
ณ จุดนี้

112
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
เครือข่าย multi-chain สองประเภทนี้

113
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
จริงๆ แล้ว

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ค่อนข้างว่างเปล่า ยังไม่มีคู่เชน

115
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
ที่เชื่อมต่อกับทั้งสองอย่างเลย

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
มันก็แค่จุดเริ่มต้น

117
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
และเป้าหมายของเราอยู่ที่ acala และ karura

118
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
จะเป็นparachainแรกใน

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
ในช่องสาธารณะบน kusama

120
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,080
กับ karura หลังจากนั้น จะเป็น

121
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,440
parachain แรกบน polkadot และ acala

122
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,280
ด้วยเบื้องหลังนี้

123
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,360
อย่างที่เราบอกไปว่าเราจะ

124
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
พูดถึง karura กันในวันนี้

125
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
เราเห็นกันจริงๆ

126
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,959
มันกลายเป็น defy hub นั่นเอง

127
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
ของระบบนิเวศ kusama

128
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,239
ตลอดจนการจัดหาผลิตภัณฑ์ ทางการเงินที่แตกต่างกัน

129
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
มากมายให้กับ

130
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
parachains ต่างๆ และ

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
application ที่เรากำลังจพเปิดตัว

132
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,159
ในระบบนิเวศของ kusama

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,560
ในความคิดของฉัน ไม่มีวิธีใด

134
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,359
ที่จะเริ่มต้นระบบนิเวศของ kusama ได้ดีไปกว่า

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,280
การเปิดตัวของ karura ก่อน

136
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
เพราะสิ่งที่เรากำลังจะ

137
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
อธิบายให้คุณฟัง และสิ่งเหล่านี้ไม่ใช่เพียง

138
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,080
ผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ akala และ kuru จะ

139
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
สามารถใช้สิ่งเหล่านี้ได้ จริงๆ

140
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
แล้วเรียกว่า primitives

141
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
เป็นแนวคิดใหม่ แต่มันถูกสร้างขึ้น

142
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
ในบล็อกเชนนั่นเอง

143
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
ซึ่งหมายความว่า ที่ทีมอื่นสามารถ

144
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
เข้ามาในระบบนิเวศได้จริงและ

145
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
ใช้ประโยชน์จากสิ่งที่ทีมของเราสร้างขึ้น

146
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
ตัวอย่างเช่น Dollart ของ Kusamaเป็น

147
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
stable coin ซึ่งไม่เพียงแต่จะใช้ใน

148
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
แอปพลิเคชันของเราเท่านั้น แต่

149
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
ยังใช้ได้กับทุกคน

150
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
บนระบบนิเวศของ kusamaอีกด้วย ดังนั้นจึงไม่มีวิธีใดที่จะดีไปกว่า

151
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
ที่จะเริ่มต้นระบบนิเวศนี้

152
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
มากกว่าที่จะสร้างแบบนี้

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
คุณรู้พื้นฐานที่สำคัญกับ karura ก่อน

154
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
แล้วจึงอนุญาต

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
ให้ทีมอื่นสร้างด้วย

156
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
สิ่งที่เรามอบให้กับ

157
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
ระบบนิเวศ สิ่งที่คุณเห็นตอนนี้

158
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
หน้าจอตอนนี้ คือ

159
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
User Interface ของจริง

160
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
บน Application Layer ที่่ทีมเรา

161
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
ได้สร้างขึ้น

162
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
ดังนั้นเราจึงมีผลิตภัณฑ์เหล่านี้

163
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,520
ที่สร้างขึ้นในบล็อกเชน แต่ทีมของเรา

164
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,680
ก็สร้างขึ้นบนเครือข่ายของเราเองด้วย

165
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
เลเยอร์แอปพลิเคชันทั้งหมด

166
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,400
ทื่คุณกำลังเห็น และนี้คือสิ่งที่

167
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,080
ruitao กำลังจะสาธิตในวันนี้

168
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,240
เพื่ออธิบายเพิ่มเติมในสิ่งที่ฉันพูดถึง

169
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
เกี่ยวกับ acala ว่าเป็นแพลตฟอร์ม

170
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
สำหรับแอปพลิเคชันแล้วยัง

171
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
เป็นชั้นแอปพลิเคชัน

172
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
ถ้าคุณเห็นไดอะแกรมนี้

173
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,479
นี่เป็นการทำงานจาก

174
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,039
ชั้น Base Layer ของ kusana ขึ้นไป ดังนั้น

175
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
สิ่งที่แสดงให้เห็น kusama นี้คือ

176
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,479
แพลตฟอร์ม multi-chain ที่

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,919
ฉันแสดงให้คุณเห็น และเรากำลังพยายาม

178
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
หาช่องใน kusama

179
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
และสิ่งที่ทำให้เราทำได้คือ plug-in

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,840
ภายในทั้งหมด

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
ของกล่องสีส้มนี้ ซึ่งก็คือ kurara

182
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880
และนี่คือ บล็อคเชนของเรา นี่คือ

183
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
บล็อคเชน Layer 1 ที่เทียบเท่า

184
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,840
อีเธอเรียมในปัจจุบัน

185
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,400
และภายใน karura มีการ

186
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,680
สร้างผลิตภัณฑ์ทางการเงินดั้งเดิมหรือผลิตภัณฑ์ทางการเงินมากมาย

187
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,919
ที่เราสามารถใช้ได้

188
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
ในแอปพลิเคชันด้านบนนี้ ดังนั้นคุณ

189
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,560
สามารถที่จะเห็น Stable Coin ที่ฉันได้กล่าวถึง

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
liquid ksm staking ที่ช่วยให้คุณ

191
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,120
stake ksm และรับใบเสร็จรับเงินได้จริง

192
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,960
สำหรับสิ่งที่คุณสามารถใช้ได้ภายใน defi

193
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
แทนที่จะเพียงแค่ staking ksm ของคุณเท่านั้น และมัน

194
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
ถูกล็อคและติดอยู่ที่นั่นและ

195
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
ไม่สามารถ

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,600
ใช้งานได้อีกแง่มุมหนึ่งคือเด็คของเรา

197
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,160
ที่ ruitao จะสาธิต ที่นี่ เร็วๆ นี้ และ

198
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
จากนี้

199
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,639
พวกคุณบางคน เรามักจะพูดถึง

200
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
วิธีปรับแต่งบล็อคเชนด้วย

201
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
substrate และสร้างขึ้น

202
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,319
สำหรับกรณีการใช้งานเฉพาะ และนี่คือสิ่งที่

203
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,479
เราหมายความตามนั้น

204
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,319
นำค่า gas ของคุณมาเป็นคุณลักษณะที่

205
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,080
ruitao จะแสดงให้ดูในวันนี้

206
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
นี่คือคุณลักษณะที่เรา

207
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
ได้ปรับแต่งเฉพาะสำหรับเชนของเรา

208
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
สำหรับ karura และ acala เพราะ พวกเรากำลังพยายาม

209
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,720
เพื่อให้มันพิเศษสำหรับ D5

210
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
และสิ่งนี้ช่วยให้คุณทำอะไรได้หากคุณ

211
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
เคยใช้ d5 และ ethereum

212
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
คุณรู้ว่าคุณไม่สามารถ

213
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,759
ทำธุรกรรมใดๆ ได้โดยไม่ต้องมี

214
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,520
eth และ หากคุณเป็นผู้ใช้ใหม่ของ ethereum

215
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
ก่อนอื่นคุณต้องเรียนรู้ว่า eth คืออะไร

216
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
คุณต้องไปหามัน

217
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,520
เป็นกระบวนการที่ยาก แต่ด้วยการนำ

218
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
ค่า gas ของคุณเองด้วย kurara และ acala มันจะ

219
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
จะช่วยให้ผู้คนนำ

220
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,919
เหรียญต่าง ๆ มาและ

221
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,560
ชำระค่าธรรมเนียมการทำธุรกรรมเริ่มต้นด้วยโทเค็นนั้นทันที

222
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
ตัวอย่างเช่น มีคนนำ bitcoin

223
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
มาที่

224
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,880
karura ก็จะสามารถนำ

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
bitcoin มา

226
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
ห่อ (wrap)และออกบน kusama

227
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
ใน karura แล้ว

228
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,120
แล้วสามารถจ่ายเงินเริ่มต้นได้ บางทีอาจเป็น

229
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,759
การ swap อาจเป็นการโอน แต่การจ่าย

230
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
ค่าธรรมเนียมนั้น

231
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
ใน btc แทนที่จะต้องออก

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,520
ไปหา

233
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
KAR โทเค็นซึ่งเป็น

234
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,759
โทเค็นยูทิลิตี้ของ karura

235
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,199
และสุดท้าย acala evm ก็เป็น

236
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,800
อีกสภาพแวดล้อมหนึ่ง

237
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
ของ ethereum เฉพาะ ที่เราสร้างขึ้น

238
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,840
สำหรับ karura โดยเฉพาะ

239
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,440
และ acala อย่างที่บอกว่าเป็น

240
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
layer 1 ตรงกลางนี่คือ

241
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,879
บล็อกเชน

242
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,560
และจากนั้นทีมของเรา

243
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
ด้สร้างแอปพลิเคชันทั้งหมด

244
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,080
ใช้ประโยชน์จากสิ่งเหล่านี้

245
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
ที่ฉันเพิ่งพูดถึงคุณไป

246
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
ruitao สิ่งที่เขาจะพูดถึงในวันนี้

247
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,080
คือชุดแอปพลิเคชัน

248
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
ทั้งหมดของเราที่สร้างขึ้นบน

249
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,919
บล็อคเชนของเรา และจำไว้

250
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,599
ว่าแน่นอนว่านี่เป็น

251
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
แพลตฟอร์มแบบเปิด ดังนั้น

252
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,560
มันจะไม่เป็นแค่การ

253
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
สร้างแอปพลิเคชันบน karura มันจะเป็น

254
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
ทีมอื่นๆ ที่เข้ามาสร้างใน

255
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,720
สภาพแวดล้อมแบบเปิด

256
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
ที่เราสร้างขึ้น

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
ฉันไม่จำเป็นต้องพูดลงลึกเกี่ยวกับเรื่องนี้ เพราะ

258
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,759
เพราะฉันแค่พูดถึงสิ่งเหล่านี้ทั้งหมด

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
แล้วนี่เป็นเพียง ระดับสูงสุด

260
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
karura โดยทั่วไป

261
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
เหล่านี้คือ

262
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
ผลิตภัณฑ์ทั้งหมดที่เราสร้างขึ้น

263
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
มีการสร้างสะพานหลายแห่ง (Bridges)

264
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
ระบบนิเวศในขณะนี้โดยเฉพาะ

265
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,360
สำหรับสิ่งที่โดดเด่นที่สุดสำหรับ

266
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,039
bitcoin และ ethereum เร็วๆนี้

267
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,680
ในไม่ช้าหลังจากที่เราเปิดตัว เราจะเห็น

268
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,399
สินทรัพย์ ethereum

269
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
ซื้อขายได้และใช้งานได้จริง

270
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,360
ภายใน decks ของเราและอื่นๆ

271
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,640
ในผลิตภัณฑ์อื่น ๆ และ

272
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,800
และนี่คือพื้นฐานของ karura

273
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
 โดยสังเขปและคล้ายกับ acalaมาก

274
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
แต่เราจะยึดติดกับ karura เพื่อ

275
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
สำหรับการนำเสนอ

276
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,240
ในวันนี้เท่านั้น

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
ดังนั้นสุดท้ายฉันคิดว่านี่เป็นสไลด์สุดท้าย แต่

278
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
คำถามหนึ่งที่หลายคนถามคือ

279
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,320
ทำไมเราถึงตัดสินใจสร้าง

280
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
karura บน kusama นอกเหนือจาก acala บน

281
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,040
polkadot

282
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
และคำตอบสำหรับคำถามนี้คือ

283
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
เรากำลังทำเช่นนี้

284
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,320
ตามความต้องการของผู้ใช้ ดังนั้น ระบบนิเวศ kusama

285
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
และระบบนิเวศ polkadot

286
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
แม้ว่าจะมีการทับซ้อนกันอยู่บ้าง

287
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
แต่ก็มีความแตกต่างกันอย่างชัดเจนในตอนนี้ และ

288
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
พวกเขามี

289
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
ชุมชนผู้ถือโทเค็นสองแห่ง

290
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,080
ที่มีความต้องการทาง defi

291
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
ดังนั้นเราจึงสร้าง karura เพื่อตอบสนอง

292
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
ความต้องการทางdefy ของ kusama และเราจะสร้าง

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
acala เพื่อตอบสนองความต้องการ d5 ของ

294
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
polkadot

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
แต่ kusama ถ้าคุณมีพื้นฐาน

296
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,200
บน kusamaมาก่อน มันควรจะเป็นสถานที่

297
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
เพื่อสนุกกับการทดลองและ

298
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
และเปิดตัว

299
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,640
ผลิตภัณฑ์ก่อนที่จะย้ายไปที่ polkadot แต่

300
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
หลังจากทดสอบอย่างหนักบน test net

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
ดังนั้น kusama จึง

302
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
จึงไม่ใช่ testnet เลย

303
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
มันคือ

304
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,000
ครือข่ายทดสอบที่เรียกว่า rococo และ westend

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,360
ได้รับการทดสอบบน testnet

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
จากนั้นย้ายไปที่ kusama แล้วย้ายไปที่ polka dot

307
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
สิ่งที่เรากำลังสร้างก็

308
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,959
เป็นไปตามเส้นทางที่คล้ายกัน

309
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
testnet ของเราเรียกว่า mandala

310
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,760
testnet จะมีการสร้าง

311
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,440
ละทดสอบและกลั่นกรองผลิตภัณฑ์ใหม่

312
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
ทดสอบ และ

313
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
หวังว่าจะเกือบจะสมบูรณ์แบบก่อน

314
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
ที่จะย้ายไปที่ karura

315
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,800
karura เป็นที่ที่เราสามารถทดลองได้จริง

316
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,800
ในสภาพแวดล้อมจริง

317
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
ด้วยคุณค่าที่แท้จริงบน

318
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
เครือข่ายที่อุดมสมบูรณ์

319
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
แล้วถ้าเราตัดสินใจว่านี่เป็นผลิตภัณฑ์

320
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
ที่ชุมชน kusama

321
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
เราก็ได้รับการตอบรับที่ดี เราสามารถ

322
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
ปรับปรุงผลิตภัณฑ์ได้ จากนั้นเราจะย้าย

323
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
ไปยัง

324
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,440
acala หลังจากนั้น

325
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
และสุดท้าย นี่เป็นแค่

326
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
การดูตัวเลขบางตัว ฉันไม่จําเป็นต้อง

327
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
เจาะลึกทั้งหมดนี้

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,240
เราเพิ่งรวมจำนวนชุมชนของเรา

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,279
เมื่อวานนี้ และเราเพิ่ง

330
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,000
ถึง 200,000 เราอยู่ที่ประมาณมากกว่า 205 000

331
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
ช่อง acala และ karura ดังนั้น

332
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
เรากำลังเติบโต

333
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
อย่างรวดเร็วมากขณะนี้ และ

334
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
และใกล้เคียงมากขึ้น

335
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,320
ขั้นตอนการทำ crowdloanและ

336
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,079
กระบวนการประมูล Parachain ที่

337
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,519
เราเคยพูดถึงมาก่อน และมี

338
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
วิดีโอบางส่วนในช่อง YouTube

339
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
ของเรา

340
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,279
สามรารถลองได้อย่างอิสระ แต่พวกเราจะไม่

341
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,680
ลงรายละเอียดเกี่ยวกับกระบวนการนั้นในวันนี้

342
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
ดังนั้น นี่คือส่วนของฉัน และตอนนี้

343
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
เราจะเข้าสู่

344
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
การสาธิตและสิ่งที่เราจะทำใน

345
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,040
ในรูปแบบของ

346
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
ที่นี่ ruitao จะมาเจาะลึก

347
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
เกี่ยวกับ

348
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,360
หนึ่งในผลิตภัณฑ์แล้วเราจะ

349
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
หยุดสักครู่แล้วปล่อยให้พวกคุณทำ Q&A

350
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
และโปรดถามคำถามโดยเฉพาะ

351
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
เกี่ยวกับ

352
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
ตัวอย่างที่เขาเพิ่งทำไป

353
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,640
ตัวอย่างเช่น หากเป็น

354
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
ส่วนของการยืม ausd นี้เป็นพียงแค่

355
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
เก็บคำถามของคุณไว้

356
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
เราจะตอบคำถามสองสามข้อ จากนั้นเขา

357
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
จะไปยังการสาธิตถัดไป เราจะทำ

358
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
Q&A สั้นๆ

359
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
จากนั้นเดโมสุดท้ายเราจะทำ

360
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
Q&A อีกครั้ง และจบลงด้วย

361
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
หัวข้อ Q&A 

362
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
เพราะฉันรู้ว่าพวกคุณมี

363
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
คำถามมากมาย

364
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
ruitao จะตอบปัญหา

365
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
ทีนี่

366
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
ยอดเยี่ยม ขอบคุณแดน

367
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,800
บทนำที่ยอดเยี่ยมมาก ฉันพึ่งแชร์หน้าจอ

368
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,680
ของฉันเพื่อให้แน่ใจ Dan เห็นหน้าจอไหมครับ

369
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,279
ทุกคนสามารถเห็นหน้าจอของฉันได้ ใช่ไหมครับ

370
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,000
ใช่ เราทำให้มันยอดเยี่ยม นี่คือ

371
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,760
ส่วนของหน้าตาเว็บไซต์ของ karura หรือ

372
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
mandala บน testnet แต่

373
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
แต่นี่จะเป็นหน้าตาเว็บไซต์

374
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,519
ของ karura

375
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
มันเหมือนกับที่แดนบอกว่า karura เอง

376
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
เป็นบล็อคเชนเฉพาะ

377
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,120
พร้อมชุดคุณสมบัติในตัว และนี่คือ

378
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
ส่วนหน้าเว็ปไซต์สำหรับคุณในการโต้ตอบ

379
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
ในฐานะผู้บริโภคในฐานะผู้ค้าเพื่อโต้ตอบ

380
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,440
กับสิ่งนี้

381
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,880
เครือข่ายเฉพาะและเห็นได้ชัดว่า

382
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,279
คุณสมบัติที่สำคัญที่สุด

383
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,680
โดยรวมคือเรามีโหมดกลางคืน และ

384
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,680
ที่เข้ากับชุดสีของ karura พอดี

385
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,120
ชุดสีมันดู ยอดเยี่ยมาก

386
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
เราจะได้หน้าตาประมาณนี้

387
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
เหมือินกับ d4

388
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
ชุดสีเมื่อเราเปิดตัวสิ่งนี้

389
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
เราเปิดตัว

390
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,880
เครือข่าย karura และหน้าแรกสุด

391
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
ที่ฉันจะแสดง

392
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,480
คือหน้ากระเป๋าเงิน นี่คือที่ที่คุณ 


393
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,279
จัดการทรัพย์สินทั้งหมดของคุณ

394
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
ภายใน karura parachain

395
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
และอย่างที่คุณเห็น

396
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,360
คุณสามารถมี

397
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
สิ่งนี้จะเปลี่ยนเป็นโทเค็น kar อย่างแน่นอน

398
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
คุณมีโทเค็น ksm ของคุณ

399
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,600
คุณมีโทเค็น kaUSDของคุณ

400
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,680
คุณสามารถโอนไปยังกระเป๋าอื่น ๆ ได้อย่างอิสระ

401
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
โดยเพียงแค่โต้ตอบ

402
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
กับส่วนหน้าของเว็ปไซต์

403
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
คุณสามารถจัดการทรัพย์สินของคุณราวกับ

404
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,720
ว่าเป็นหนึ่งใน

405
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
การรวมสินทรัพย์ของคุณ

406
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
การเข้าถึงการถ่ายโอนมูลค่า

407
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,279
หรือเข้าถึงสิ่งต่าง ๆ เช่น minting btc

408
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,200
การmint เหรียญ polkaBTC หรือทำการถ่ายโอน parachain

409
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,480
เช่น ถ้าฉันต้องการ

410
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
ถ่ายโอน

411
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,079
สินทรัพย์ acala จาก acala ไป อย่างเช่น

412
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,639
hydra decks

413
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,160
ฉันสามารถเลือกที่นี่และทำการแลกเปลี่ยน

414
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,040
ดังนั้นนี่คือ

415
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,240
almost looks like an uh a user very

416
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,480
friendly wallet they can

417
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
you can access like um in my opinion way

418
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
better than just um

419
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
than just using polkadot.js to to to

420
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,760
interact with the

421
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
blockchain so this is that's what i was

422
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
gonna ask you right

423
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
so as we go through this i'm just gonna

424
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,839
ask questions that i think

425
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,760
people in the audience might be

426
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,000
wondering so what you're showing here is

427
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
a

428
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
wallet that can be used similar to

429
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,399
people have on polka dot js now or even

430
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,079
some of their mobile wallets but

431
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
when they connect what they would do to

432
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
actually see these numbers here is it

433
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,760
correct that they would go up to the

434
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
polka dot

435
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,680
js extension and connect their polka dot

436
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,399
js account to this wallet and it would

437
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,040
show

438
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
their live balances within this wallet

439
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,720
is that

440
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,160
yes yes yes definitely and the poke.js

441
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,279
is very similar to the

442
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,440
metamask equivalent on polka dots

443
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,959
you can manage multiple account in this

444
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,399
wallet section as well so i can change

445
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,320
to another demo account here

446
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
you can see all the stuff i refresh on

447
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
the fly i can change back to my original

448
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,279
demo account

449
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,399
and you can also see a history of your

450
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,240
past transaction

451
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,440
so very very user friendly very very

452
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,160
consumer focused

453
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
this is your your your one stop to

454
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:30,160
access your your assets

455
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:32,560
on kura

456
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
so then do do we want to um see if

457
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,480
there's any questions that would like to

458
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,800
um

459
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,639
to um to answer regarding this wallet

460
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,199
interface or should we carry on to work

461
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
on the

462
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,399
next section which is the borrowing uh

463
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,600
the borrowing

464
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,040
of the stable coin

465
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
um let's see

466
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
it might be hard to actually sort

467
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,600
through this

468
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,199
box it okay so if you guys have

469
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
questions specific to one of these

470
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,000
demos i'll be actually watching this the

471
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,079
chat here so

472
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
which wall someone says which wallet is

473
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,040
chosen for this is it the

474
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,160
ksm wallet um

475
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,639
well this is like the um

476
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
if you use pocket.js as the extension

477
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
this is

478
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,800
essentially your access to both kusama

479
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,320
and polkadot

480
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,160
and kura and alcohol like every single

481
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
subject-based blockchain they go gonna

482
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,519
all be manageable by pocket.js

483
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
so think about this it's like a

484
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,480
multifunction version of metamask you

485
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,360
arrive at carrura and you access to your

486
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,920
current asset using your sam

487
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,920
pog.js extension

488
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
yeah so you basically connect one

489
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,399
account from your polka dot js and then

490
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
it shows you every wallet that's kind of

491
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,560
connected to that

492
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
account yes yes

493
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,880
and obviously in pogo.js you have the

494
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,639
right um your the way to manage like i

495
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
would like to use this on alkala

496
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
i only wanted to use this um this

497
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,880
particular water address

498
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
maybe only on relay chain on kusama all

499
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
you can say that i would like to use

500
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,120
this

501
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,560
wallet in all the available power chains

502
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,920
and relay chance so you can

503
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,320
get it's the your the user's um

504
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,000
um ability to choose like where this

505
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
wallet is going to be made available and

506
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,959
if you make it available

507
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,440
for garura it will appear here and you

508
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,279
can manage that yep

509
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,920
yeah um p i see this guy name or this

510
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
this person named p just was asking

511
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,360
about

512
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,160
the branding here so when the kala is

513
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
launched

514
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
um it's going to only say akala and have

515
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,199
the akala logo

516
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,279
when carrera launches it'll have the

517
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
carrera logo in the upper left

518
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
and then this is always going to say

519
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,480
this for the test net so akala mandala

520
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,639
is the test net

521
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,240
um so yeah that will be that will be

522
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,800
only the the name of the

523
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,399
the network when they're live yeah and i

524
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
also want to give a little bit hint here

525
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,279
so

526
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
kura is the sister network of alcala

527
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,160
right so when they

528
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,480
when they're born they are almost

529
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
identical but when they go live and

530
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,040
when the genesis happens um the two

531
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,559
network might take different paths like

532
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,640
you might see assets that will be only

533
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
available on kurura because like they

534
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,039
will be

535
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,799
only available on kusama or you might

536
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,439
see feature they'll be only available on

537
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,199
kura

538
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,039
because like it's the wild cousin of

539
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,959
polka dots and you will see the similar

540
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,439
stuff happened on kura as the main

541
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,280
alcohol is the main as well so when they

542
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,240
generalize this um it's the same

543
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,000
but they might evolve into its own

544
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,360
distinctive um

545
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,760
set of features perfect

546
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,480
well let's move on to the next uh the

547
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,240
next demo

548
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,720
we've got keith and um

549
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,600
who else was that sage are both

550
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
interested in

551
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
in borrowing on the platform so let's

552
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
get into that

553
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
yeah no problem and this is one the

554
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,919
reason that i we think why kuru is so

555
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
useful

556
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
when it's become a project you can

557
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
unlock the utility

558
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,000
of your kusama token and start to um to

559
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,120
to to borrow against your your

560
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,280
uh your kyokusama token so this is the

561
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
borrowing interface you can see an

562
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
overview of your current position so you

563
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,240
can see

564
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,679
you have i have already borrowed open a

565
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
position on ram bdc

566
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
i borrow roughly three thousand dollars

567
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
against zero point one run bdc

568
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,880
that's a little bit risky but i mean

569
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,640
that's what um the system allows

570
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
um you can actually create loans using

571
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,880
any sort of asset that will be

572
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
available in the governance process

573
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
allowed to be using crypto

574
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,360
and in this particular interface here i

575
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
have dot

576
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
l dot which we'll be covering later and

577
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
this will be definitely it would be like

578
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,200
kusama

579
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,760
el kikuzama and bitcoins so what i'm

580
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
going to

581
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,960
demo here is that i'm going to borrow

582
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
more

583
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,320
against my 0.1 ram btc position here

584
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
so you can see um the current bitcoin

585
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,400
oracle rate is

586
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,919
roughly that number i'm still quite safe

587
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,720
um to borrow a little bit more

588
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,760
against that 0.1 ram bdc so i'm going to

589
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
press generate more

590
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
i'm going to press hey i will actually

591
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,400
probably ten dollars more and press

592
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
confirm

593
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
and this is where the signing comes up i

594
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,280
will gonna type in my key

595
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,360
password and sign the transaction and

596
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
boom i have ten dollar more that i can

597
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
spend and this is how fast um

598
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
and project network looks like and all

599
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,600
this is happening on the fly for real

600
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,880
um and you can actually see this on the

601
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
on the on the block scanner that's

602
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
provided by sub scan

603
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,679
so um this is amazing right this is um

604
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,480
much much

605
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
more um responsive much much more

606
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
user-friendly

607
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,160
also i can also replay i can pay back as

608
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,080
i set a position if i think um

609
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
i'm going to reduce a little bit of risk

610
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,400
here i can pay 100 year ausd

611
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
that's like reducing my calculation

612
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,520
ratio

613
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
and any asset that will be available

614
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
through the governance process can be

615
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
borrowed against

616
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
different assets would have different

617
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,039
risk parameters so for example bitcoin

618
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,640
might have a risk parameter

619
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,600
on the medieval credit ratio on the

620
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,640
liquidation ratio on the liquidation fee

621
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,440
jobs ldots ksm lksm they might all have

622
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,520
different

623
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,880
ratio they'll be managed and governed by

624
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
the governance process

625
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
so that is essentially how you borrow

626
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,840
against um

627
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,799
crychos in kura

628
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,760
let so maybe one thing we can do this

629
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,240
concept

630
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,840
of collateralization and taking loans is

631
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
probably new to a lot of people i know

632
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,720
it was new to me

633
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,880
um at one point and basically like to to

634
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,280
make this as simple as possible

635
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
um like i think many of us are aware of

636
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
how like a home

637
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,720
loan works where typically you might put

638
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
like 10 down or 20

639
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
down that cash that you put down is what

640
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
you're putting

641
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
down in order to get the full the full

642
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
loan of whatever you're getting for that

643
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,679
house

644
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,440
but with the way this works in crypto um

645
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,799
we're actually over you're over

646
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,039
collateralizing

647
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,240
the loan so that's why these collateral

648
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,200
ratios are over

649
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,039
100 and you're what you're doing like

650
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
what it really means of collateral

651
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,640
is that you're actually taking bitcoin

652
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,120
something like bitcoin

653
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
you don't need to sell it but you can

654
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
pull out

655
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,280
um ausd a stablecoin with your bitcoin

656
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
still there not sold and then you can

657
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
take the ausd

658
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,919
and either you can send that to people

659
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,080
you can make payments you can

660
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
use that to provide liquidity within our

661
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,200
decks but

662
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,120
that's essentially what this collateral

663
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
ratio means and i don't know ruta if you

664
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,200
have any more to

665
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,200
add to that yeah essentially give you

666
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
more utility um to the asset that you

667
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,120
are holding to

668
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
that you might not want to sell or in in

669
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,880
short term

670
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,679
and for example for fukusama for for

671
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,080
lksm those are perfectly great

672
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,400
collectors for you to gain more utility

673
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,480
out of your 16 kusama holdings you can

674
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
go long you can go short you can

675
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
it's i mean the option is it's in your

676
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,960
hand to decide how you're going to use

677
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,240
this collector

678
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,280
um to trade and ride with the market

679
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,520
and broderick asked what about

680
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
interest so are you paying interest when

681
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,440
you're taking out

682
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,280
these loans and how does that work yes

683
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
so the interest essentially is what we

684
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
call the stabilization fee

685
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,720
if you take a long there will be

686
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,880
definitely some interest occur

687
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,200
and this is also the interest used to

688
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,919
manage the supply and demand

689
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
of the stablecar as well as like the um

690
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,240
the way to maintain that the stablecoin

691
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
will be

692
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,760
packed to to to a dollar in value and

693
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,320
the increase

694
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,159
um all the stabilization fee will be

695
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
managed by the governance process

696
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,919
really depends on demands and supplies

697
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,240
and do you know your interest rate

698
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,679
before you take out the loan

699
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
obviously definitely so let's say that

700
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,440
we want to create a lot we're going to

701
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,360
create some ldl ksm and scripto

702
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,880
i'm going to put in maybe 5l uh l ksm

703
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,520
here and i'm gonna taking maybe like two

704
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
dollar loan

705
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,799
you can already see that um um

706
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,919
the amount of money that you can borrow

707
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,120
the interest rate in here the

708
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,280
liquidation penalty

709
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,320
and if things goes wrong that where how

710
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,080
you can but

711
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
in chance that if you over capitalize

712
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,480
and the position becomes risky

713
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,280
you might get liquidated so this is the

714
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
um the

715
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,640
the the figure that you're able to see

716
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,720
before you

717
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
create a lawn and the final confirmation

718
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,799
stage you will be

719
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,039
once again so go ahead and confirm all

720
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,600
the numbers and press confirm and this

721
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,159
is how you

722
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,640
open a long position so i just created a

723
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
loan

724
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,360
using my lksm and received like two

725
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
dollars so you can say if i now go back

726
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
to an interface

727
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,960
i have two position open one with

728
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,120
bitcoin one with um lksm

729
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
those is like um and i totally have

730
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
borrowed probably like few thousand

731
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,200
dollars against both

732
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,280
um lksm and ram bdc okay

733
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,600
that makes sense and someone asked where

734
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
does that interest actually go

735
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,880
well the ancient cities actually go to

736
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
the treasury um

737
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
and being managed by the network right

738
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,960
it's it's essentially

739
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
controlled by the network for the long

740
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,919
prosperity of the network

741
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
the interest ultimately would be the

742
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
surplus within this system and

743
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
if you read our white paper regarding

744
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,880
the decentralized sovereign wales fund

745
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,360
the interest is ultimately hold managed

746
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,640
by the token holders

747
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,159
okay um one other question that's that's

748
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,760
relevant i think um the liquidation

749
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
concept i think is new to a lot of

750
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,200
people and

751
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,480
my so basically what the he he asked uh

752
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,760
what happens if the

753
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,159
token that is basically collateralized

754
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,480
with the value drops so

755
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
liquidation in this sense does not mean

756
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,600
that you kind of like

757
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,440
lose everything that you put down that's

758
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
why there was a liquidation percentage

759
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
so

760
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,200
in the example rota just showed it said

761
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,520
20

762
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
so what that means is if the price of

763
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,640
the underlying

764
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,480
collateral asset that you put down say

765
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
it's bitcoin for example if the price

766
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,520
were to drop

767
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,720
to a point where it became risky

768
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,400
according to what the

769
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,559
the system says here then your

770
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
your position would basically be sold at

771
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,559
a at a

772
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,159
rate of a 20 kind of um fee

773
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,799
for that for that liquidation take

774
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,799
taking place

775
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,600
yeah yeah i think to better um think

776
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,760
about liquidation it's more of like

777
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,679
uh if you collateralize and you borrow

778
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
against your bitcoin and then pick a job

779
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,960
to a particular price

780
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
a fraction of your collection will be

781
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
sold and you will see that if you were

782
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
just like sold those collectors

783
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,159
at that price you will still hold on to

784
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
the the money they borrow against it's

785
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
just like

786
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,679
you sold those um characters at a

787
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,679
penalty

788
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,679
yep cool well let's move on to the next

789
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
one

790
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,960
okay so the next um section we're gonna

791
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
cover is the

792
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,320
uh the decks that's where you can trade

793
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,039
um assets

794
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,840
are gonna be available on kura and asset

795
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,400
is gonna be

796
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,159
available in the wider kusama ecosystem

797
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,559
this is where you can trade so you can

798
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,080
see i just borrowed some ausd or kusd

799
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,840
the stable coin i can already start to

800
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,679
trade for example to trade

801
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,480
uh 100 uh kusd for maybe some

802
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,919
poker btc and i can say that okay this

803
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
is what i'm going to trace very similar

804
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,880
to uni swap

805
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
an am type of change i can press one

806
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
button

807
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
and then boom i will be trading and

808
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,799
bought some some poker btc

809
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,440
um the other way i can also trade

810
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,679
against by selling for example some some

811
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,400
program bdc and get some property

812
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,240
um dots or something else as long as

813
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
there's liquidity you can trade

814
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,520
within these stacks this stack is super

815
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,159
useful um when

816
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,600
the network um boot shaped it's going to

817
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,880
be one of the very first stacks that's

818
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,360
going to available

819
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,559
on kusama that allow you to trade in a

820
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,880
trustless way

821
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
and also because it's like an mm type of

822
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,400
exchange you can also

823
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,240
provide liquidity so you can provide

824
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,799
liquidity in sense of like

825
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,559
supplying a set of pairs into the pool

826
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,320
for example electrical by usd

827
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,240
to dodge and you can supply that will

828
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,799
approve x amount of usd and x amount of

829
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,520
dots

830
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,600
by supplying liquidity into this tax you

831
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
are essentially a market maker

832
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,880
and passive money maker you will be

833
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,440
earning the

834
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,400
the liquidity um the trading fee you'll

835
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,080
be earning

836
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,520
um all the um rewards um when you are

837
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,000
providing this liquidity

838
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,679
so every time that people trade um you

839
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
essentially help them to trade and

840
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
you by doing that you'll be ending some

841
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,080
nice share of the

842
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:16,159
of the trading fees um by providing this

843
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,880
liquidity um this this exchange itself

844
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,320
as for consumer is already quite useful

845
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
but it also has some

846
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,039
actual functionality it's actually the

847
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,960
backbone the unified source of liquidity

848
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,399
um for the whole cruel network which i

849
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,559
will cover later

850
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
when we show off the gas feed payment

851
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,080
feature but for now

852
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
we can see this is like already a very

853
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,960
very user

854
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,520
friendly consumer friendly way for you

855
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,159
to trade in a trustless way on kusama

856
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,159
and kura

857
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,799
and just uh just to mention again what

858
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,760
rutao mentioned earlier

859
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,799
this this is just our test net so when

860
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,159
carrera launches

861
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,440
these will be ksm focus so what you see

862
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,000
here is ausd

863
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,559
and aca when when carrera launches this

864
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
will say

865
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,640
kusd which is the carrera dollar and

866
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,000
it'll say

867
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:11,120
kar here instead of aca which is the

868
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,120
the utility token of kubura yeah

869
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,240
um another thing okay so ben is asking

870
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,880
something like what's the earnings share

871
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960
for participating in the liquidity pool

872
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
so one thing to mention is that we've

873
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,520
set aside

874
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,320
um it's six percent uh right rutau of

875
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
our of the

876
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,720
kar the karua supply for the initial

877
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,840
liquidity provider

878
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,919
program so this is this is a bit of an

879
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
alpha leak i think on this on this call

880
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,399
but definitely uh

881
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,919
something that will reward early

882
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,559
liquidity providers who

883
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
who bring in whatever it might be if

884
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,320
it's ksm

885
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,600
or what have you um there will be there

886
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
will be an opportunity to provide

887
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
liquidity for

888
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,159
for any of these pairs on the career

889
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,320
decks from day one when we launched

890
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
yes yes i think this is another reason

891
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,000
that why um

892
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,399
we think kuru is going to be so amazing

893
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,600
for kusama token holders because you can

894
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,200
actually put the kusama token into work

895
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,080
for you right you can simply provide

896
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,159
liquidity

897
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,360
uh in the cruel network and start to

898
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,520
enjoy return

899
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
um for participating in this network and

900
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,960
for the uh

901
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,880
for the for the rewards when providing

902
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,880
liquidity they actually double reward

903
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
in the very first year that we as then

904
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,279
mentioned so you will be earning the

905
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,600
typical

906
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,200
liquidity provider fee that's like uh

907
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,960
pretty much industry standard if you

908
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
check out like sushi swap you can check

909
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,679
out that uni swap

910
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,840
um they already pretty much like to eat

911
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,399
the standard liquid liquidity provider

912
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,399
fee

913
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,399
but in additional you will be earning uh

914
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,200
some liquidity reward for the for early

915
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,840
contribution

916
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,559
for kurura and as then said we set aside

917
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,399
a set of

918
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
kura token to be used for that

919
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:54,000
particular

920
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,960
incentive as well a couple people are

921
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
asking about

922
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,080
um impermanent loss when providing

923
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,559
liquidity

924
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
yeah definitely like if um obviously in

925
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,399
the

926
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,880
in in short run or in short term if you

927
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,120
check

928
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
uni swap there's like this problem of

929
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,240
impediment loss

930
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,799
um when you're providing um liquidity

931
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,360
pair to let's say two very volatile

932
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,120
assets uh it's in the in the very

933
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
beginning it's almost the same for

934
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,760
providing liquidity

935
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,440
uh in um in kura as well so you will

936
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,000
experience some of the implement loss in

937
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,080
short term

938
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
but in long term um if you actually

939
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,360
check the historic data

940
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,200
in long term that pretty much all turns

941
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,200
out to be great um the additional

942
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,559
incentive that we have in place

943
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
for kr tokens um as liquidity rewards

944
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,159
for providing

945
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,120
early liquidity will even offstat that

946
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,440
if there's any

947
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,960
even further and we have some exciting

948
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,080
stuff that we may come up later when we

949
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,120
start to roll up

950
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,840
stuff one by one as i said uh or as dan

951
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,799
described

952
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,679
um kuru and alkala a specialized network

953
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,480
right it's like

954
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
a network specialized for finance um so

955
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
when when we go live it's not going to

956
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,559
stay in this straight we're going to

957
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,640
continue

958
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,080
to improve and continue to grow up new

959
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,600
feature on top of that

960
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
that's the hints i can give up today

961
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,559
cool yeah i guess we can move on to the

962
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,279
next

963
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,640
section someone was asking like when you

964
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,559
can do this when you can provide

965
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,399
liquidity when you can use

966
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,760
um the decks and the answer is the

967
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,399
moment we launch

968
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,279
so karua we just need to win the pair

969
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,679
chain slot

970
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
auction and the moment we win that um

971
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,679
all these

972
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,360
as you can see right now this is all

973
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,159
built we've been actually waiting

974
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,039
to launch this so the moment we can get

975
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,840
our

976
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,919
our slots in the kusama network we'll go

977
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,039
live and this stuff will all be usable

978
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,679
um from the moment we we get started

979
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,000
yeah so the next section is about liquid

980
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,080
staking and this is super amazing i

981
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
i just can't wait to use this feature so

982
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,120
the liquid staking in essentially in a

983
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
nutshell is like

984
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,440
it's a meta a trustless staking pool

985
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,320
that you can free

986
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,320
your stake asset so think about as like

987
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,720
if you're holding kusama today

988
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,840
and if you stick with validators which

989
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
you should

990
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,519
every time that you want to spend or you

991
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,240
want to move your kusama you have this

992
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,559
typical

993
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,840
seven day uploading period for the

994
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
security of the network

995
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,000
and on polkadot it's even longer it's 28

996
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,760
days for unbounding your stack assets

997
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,440
so what we created as what we call

998
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,440
liquid staking essentially

999
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,799
a trustless staking pool that you can

1000
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
stack using

1001
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,880
a kura and every time that you stake you

1002
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
will be getting a receipt

1003
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,039
of your stake assets uh because it's

1004
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,080
trustless the receipt of your state

1005
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
asset

1006
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,360
is what we call lksm so lksm is

1007
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,320
you bailing as long as you hold on to

1008
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
lksm

1009
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,399
you will be earning the staking reward

1010
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,760
it's also safe because it's trustless

1011
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,760
it's always guaranteed that you can

1012
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,480
redeem for more

1013
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,519
uh ksm when you want to redeem the the

1014
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
ksm back

1015
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,720
so um this is something that's extremely

1016
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,399
extremely

1017
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,880
user-friendly i think everyone should be

1018
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,799
using this if you hold a hokusama

1019
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,720
um and i'm gonna demonstrate here right

1020
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,120
so um for me to stay in this

1021
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,080
techniques trusting uh in this trustless

1022
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,480
staking pool

1023
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,120
it's as simple as i just swap some some

1024
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,960
dots or some ksm into lksm

1025
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,720
we make the user interface looks like

1026
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
swapping but inside instead this is not

1027
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,799
this is staking

1028
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,159
so i'm going to say that i'm going to

1029
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,399
stick and this is um

1030
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,679
essentially it's taking one ksm and

1031
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,679
exchange i get z

1032
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,840
i get 10 lks and bad the the this ratio

1033
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,039
is determined by the system uh we're

1034
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,640
going to improve this

1035
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,159
user interface later so it's always say

1036
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,519
that uh one

1037
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,919
ksm will be equal to one lksm and then

1038
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,679
one lksm will be equal to more and more

1039
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,519
ksm when you redeem later

1040
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,760
that's like if you hold on to lksm you

1041
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,919
will be growing very similar to how you

1042
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,519
save money in compound your money will

1043
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,000
be growing that's like you are earning

1044
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,840
interest

1045
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,360
but in this particular in the in your

1046
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,559
liquid staking you are earning the

1047
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,640
staking reward

1048
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,600
the lksm go ahead again let me just

1049
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,960
explain that so in this case you can see

1050
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
dot and l dot so

1051
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,960
that might be easier so what you're

1052
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,280
doing here is you're staking dot

1053
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,079
and say you're staking 10 dot you would

1054
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,159
get 10

1055
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,839
l dot in return and those liquid dots

1056
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,639
can be used within

1057
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,919
akala if it's dot um but what what

1058
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,480
ruitan mentioned is

1059
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,079
how this l dot is a receipt for your for

1060
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
your staked dot

1061
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,560
so if you can imagine like on the on the

1062
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,079
wallet screen that rue tau showed you

1063
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,480
with all of your balances

1064
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,520
your l dot balance will actually always

1065
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,200
be going up

1066
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,119
because it's it's showing you it's a

1067
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,359
receipt for your staked dot

1068
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,359
so as your staked dot starts earning

1069
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,480
more and more staking rewards that'll be

1070
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,280
reflected in your

1071
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,720
ldot balance so when you go to redeem

1072
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,000
your ldot

1073
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,720
for like native dot at the end

1074
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,760
whenever you want to unstake your l dot

1075
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,160
will have gone up

1076
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
since the moment you actually got your

1077
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,000
original l dot if that makes sense

1078
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,720
because it's just it's always reflecting

1079
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,160
your staking rewards adding on to your

1080
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,119
stack of ldap yeah think about

1081
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
as if eldor is a share of the pool of

1082
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,920
the staking pool

1083
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,200
and the staking pool is growing size

1084
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,000
because there's going to be staking

1085
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
reward that's

1086
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,079
praying to the pool but you can always

1087
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
redeem um for the same share that you

1088
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,359
put it in

1089
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,359
so your your that up the the redeeming

1090
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,839
number will be always growing so holding

1091
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,760
lg holding lksm is as if you are

1092
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,320
staking yeah

1093
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
and it's slightly if you have l or you

1094
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,720
have lksm

1095
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,880
because we call it liquid right it's

1096
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,599
actually transferable within the archive

1097
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,839
shot and

1098
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,680
within the wider pocket ecosystem you

1099
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,440
can send ldap to someone else you can

1100
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,320
send lksm to someone else

1101
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,280
as he was just moving um as if he's just

1102
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
moving some

1103
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,800
of some some transferrable assets um the

1104
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,920
the recipient who gets lg or google

1105
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
gets klksm can choose to continue to

1106
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,200
hold

1107
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,760
on the the lks ml dot or they can

1108
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,400
continue to

1109
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,760
decide to redeem um and get the actual

1110
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
valina dot back

1111
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
so this is like the the reason we call

1112
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,359
it liquid is that it's transferable it

1113
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,240
could be used for other utility as well

1114
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,079
and one big utility that you can use

1115
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,720
with this l ksm is that

1116
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,520
you can actually borrow against um your

1117
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,760
lksm

1118
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
in the demo that i showed earlier is

1119
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
that you can borrow

1120
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,000
against your stack asset so you don't

1121
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
actually have to give up your

1122
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,640
opportunity cost if you say that you

1123
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,320
want to borrow against thoughts

1124
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,599
you have to choose that hey do i want to

1125
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
select these thoughts or do i want to

1126
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,200
borrow against my dog

1127
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
but with ldl always lksm this is the

1128
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,160
best of both

1129
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
you could be earning the staking reward

1130
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,839
while you're borrowing against a

1131
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
position

1132
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,240
and yeah um dan any any question

1133
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,359
yeah one question um from

1134
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,760
jack here in the chat is it's basically

1135
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,760
like

1136
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
what he said what happens if you trade

1137
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,320
or sell your ldot so you have like the

1138
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,520
stake dot you get this l dot

1139
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,920
let's say you sell it all and you have

1140
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,400
so what happens then to your original

1141
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,440
dot like how do you actually

1142
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,079
either pay for that or get get the dot

1143
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,320
so think about the outdoor it's like an

1144
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
a receipt or redeems the receipt for

1145
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000
your stakedown right so if you sell your

1146
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,320
l dot you actually sell the right

1147
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,160
to redeem those stocks so it's as if you

1148
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,280
sell the dollar someone else so in the

1149
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,760
demo that i just showed

1150
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,560
uh earlier if i transfer some ldl to

1151
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,560
somewhere else

1152
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,839
i was transferring the the redeem right

1153
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839
of the underlying dot

1154
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,760
to someone else so it's as if i was

1155
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
sending dots so if you sew them then you

1156
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,560
just slice

1157
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
your solder dots it's um it's no longer

1158
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,839
yours and

1159
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,920
yeah the redeem right for that length is

1160
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,040
also no longer yours

1161
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,920
okay so the the l dot isn't connected

1162
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,320
directly to

1163
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,200
like a specific dot it's kind of that

1164
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
pool so if i so if jack here who asked a

1165
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
question

1166
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,359
sent me his l dot i could type that l

1167
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,280
dot and redeem it for dot

1168
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,280
in the akala pool yes yeah okay

1169
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,280
yeah the moment that you the moment that

1170
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,599
you stick with the the

1171
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
liquid sticking pool um the dog enter

1172
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,400
the pool

1173
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,000
and you essentially get is that what you

1174
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,640
essentially get back is the right to

1175
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
redeem

1176
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,480
for the dog and because dog itself is

1177
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
not functional it's fungible like every

1178
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,280
single dog is the same

1179
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,800
you can't say that okay that dog is my

1180
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
dog and that dog is your dog they are

1181
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,440
all dogs

1182
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,359
yes this guy this sage law said so the

1183
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,599
ldad is like the title to a car

1184
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,280
so if you sell the title someone else

1185
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,200
kind of owns the car

1186
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,079
yes since um another good question is

1187
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,800
basically could you explain how the the

1188
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,560
interest

1189
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
or the staking interest works since

1190
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,800
you're staking

1191
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,079
with a kala versus i guess in the in

1192
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,839
this case with karua so if you're

1193
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,040
staking your ksm with karua it's not

1194
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,520
staking like

1195
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,040
directly into the kusama chain there's

1196
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,000
this there's this kind of application

1197
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,760
layer so

1198
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
they're asking who is paying that

1199
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,560
percent interest for

1200
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,480
um in the carrera case lksm staking

1201
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,920
how does that work well well awesome

1202
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
like this is a good question right so

1203
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
the

1204
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,040
um think about the um the liquid staking

1205
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,440
pool as a trustless staking pool

1206
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,200
the dot other the ksm that you deposit

1207
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,160
into the pool will be managed by the

1208
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,320
network and the

1209
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,200
network will then nominate those dots

1210
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,000
into the

1211
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,440
um validator within the kusama network

1212
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,760
and if this dot is

1213
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,480
these pool sizes grow in size it will be

1214
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,280
managed it will be nominated across

1215
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,000
multiple validators in the in the kusama

1216
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,119
network

1217
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,480
so ultimately the staking reward of the

1218
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,119
of um staking by minting the lksm would

1219
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,520
be

1220
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,160
equivalent to the average eu of the

1221
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,359
network it will be safer because like d2

1222
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,760
is spread across

1223
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,480
multiple validators so even a slash

1224
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,760
happens

1225
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,440
the risk of like the pool is sort of

1226
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,440
like meditated

1227
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,040
because only slash a portion a tiny

1228
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,200
portion of that but the same

1229
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,079
um the sticking reward is also the

1230
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
average eu

1231
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,359
it's like a safe average view of the

1232
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,359
expected return

1233
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:07,119
of the network and one key other

1234
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,240
fact we need to understand is also the

1235
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,760
lksm holders actually can vote for

1236
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,880
validators so this is what we are

1237
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,200
working progress so

1238
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,240
when you meet lksm you guys you have the

1239
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,920
the right to say that i

1240
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,720
prefer the pool to validate and delegate

1241
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,440
the ksm into this set of validators and

1242
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,839
ultimately

1243
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,359
the pool would check all the input from

1244
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,480
the lksm holders

1245
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,640
and nominate those um those um kusama

1246
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,680
for across all the validators um as

1247
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,599
proportion as a portion

1248
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,880
okay so yeah so if i'm understanding

1249
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,359
correctly just to

1250
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,040
to reiterate this for um i forget who

1251
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,040
who asked that question but

1252
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
with kusama now if you're staking

1253
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,800
through polka dot js it's you as a user

1254
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,520
staking directly to

1255
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,240
a validator or a set of validators in

1256
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,160
this case

1257
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,520
in this case there's kirura in the

1258
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,920
middle so you

1259
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,560
stake with karua karua distributes the

1260
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,200
stake of

1261
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,200
everyone on karua to an evenly

1262
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,520
distributed set of validators across

1263
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,319
kusama and then all the returns coming

1264
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,720
in from

1265
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,880
those validators are pooled and then

1266
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
evenly distributed at the average

1267
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,880
across all the validators that career is

1268
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,040
staking with

1269
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
yes and if this is like a centralized

1270
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,599
staking service then you have the risk

1271
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,680
of the

1272
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
centralized entity being default you

1273
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,480
have this chart you have to trust the

1274
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,560
centralized entity

1275
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,800
um to do the right thing but since um

1276
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,520
the the liquid staking protocol that we

1277
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,920
currently have

1278
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,640
is trustless everything is managed on

1279
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
chen

1280
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,160
uh you can think of like it's like an

1281
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,400
advanced version of smart contract

1282
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,839
um everyone is staking in a trustless

1283
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,040
way and there's no risk of

1284
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,160
um of being um managed by one single

1285
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,000
centralized entity

1286
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,000
so this is the i think this is awesome

1287
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,119
this is the way to go um for

1288
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,359
um in a sense yokusama even you stick

1289
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,040
through the liquid staking

1290
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,160
yokusama never leave your custody

1291
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,160
yep we have some just really good

1292
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,560
questions here so um

1293
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,040
kalyan asked um

1294
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,200
okay so by staking or by making dot

1295
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,160
liquid are we compromising the safety of

1296
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,280
the polka dot

1297
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,880
chain the dot can be slash still be

1298
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,920
slashed right

1299
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,520
um what happens then the

1300
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,400
so basically he's asking what happens

1301
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,079
with like network security and slashing

1302
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,160
okay i think this is an awesome question

1303
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,319
right so um if the

1304
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
polka dots network security can be

1305
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,240
compromised

1306
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,359
by saying that you simply pull up the um

1307
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,920
the dot together

1308
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,560
and make it transferable and make it

1309
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,960
liquid

1310
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,720
then i think um it's gonna happen anyway

1311
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,000
like there's always a lot of centralized

1312
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,160
entities so if you stick with

1313
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,680
finance today you can already transfer

1314
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,880
your stack asset you can trade it in the

1315
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,800
market or things like that

1316
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,240
so the thing is that i we don't think

1317
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
this is going to affect the

1318
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,359
um the pokers network security at all

1319
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,960
because ultimately

1320
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,440
if by simply reprogram or by gaming by

1321
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,440
by

1322
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,880
building something on top of the network

1323
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,640
and you can affect security

1324
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,560
then there's actually a security problem

1325
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,839
of the underlying layer in this in our

1326
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,319
case we don't think that's

1327
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,079
gonna have any problem um the other key

1328
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,599
stuff to think about if you stick

1329
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,920
through this particular

1330
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,359
liquid staking pool you actually do not

1331
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,880
have the

1332
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,319
like the risk-free way to say that you

1333
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,280
are no longer getting chance of getting

1334
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,720
slashed

1335
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,560
so if the liquid staking pool was

1336
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,880
delegating or nominating

1337
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,160
let's say across 50 validators and one

1338
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,839
of those getting slashed

1339
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,280
the pool actually will get a hit of

1340
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,160
getting this slashed but

1341
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
the the result of like spreading this

1342
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,359
pool

1343
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,800
across 50 validator is that even though

1344
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
you you're getting slash in one

1345
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,240
validator

1346
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,839
the overall damage for the whole pool is

1347
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
particularly low and that's why i say

1348
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,319
it's a

1349
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,839
safe way to stake uh it's getting the

1350
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,680
average view of the network

1351
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,960
it's not trying to seek for the maximum

1352
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,640
return

1353
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,720
but it's also a very very user-friendly

1354
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,960
way that you can always expect to earn

1355
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,720
the expected return of the network

1356
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,240
um if you were stating by yourself and

1357
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
if you're nominating your dot to one

1358
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,440
particular

1359
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,040
validator and then if that validator was

1360
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,640
misbehaving it slashed

1361
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,720
then you will get a you will take a

1362
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,319
touch by normally getting that validator

1363
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,319
if you stick through this pool

1364
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,400
there's still chances that value gets

1365
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,880
latched but the overall cost

1366
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,520
for the pool holders will be even out

1367
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,839
and will be

1368
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,839
reduced

1369
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,459
cool so hopefully that helps kalyan

1370
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,459
[Music]

1371
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,800
oh another thing to maybe mention or

1372
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,960
show

1373
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,960
is um one of the current issues on

1374
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,720
polka dot and kusama right now is are

1375
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,440
the there are two things the staking

1376
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,079
minimums

1377
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,599
are becoming super high on polka dot and

1378
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,720
also on kusama

1379
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,920
um so what this allows is

1380
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,400
for people to come in and stake dot with

1381
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,280
like virtually no minimum right like

1382
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,160
what would the yes

1383
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,200
what would the actual minimum be so this

1384
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,599
is like um

1385
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,880
i have friends that has like 40 dots

1386
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,560
right and my friend really wants to

1387
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,000
steak but you can't because the mini

1388
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,079
mistaking amount on product

1389
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,359
currently i think it's over 200 which is

1390
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,000
um a lot

1391
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,599
but in this if you stick through um kura

1392
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,119
or if you stick through alcohol

1393
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,800
you actually can get you can actually

1394
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,200
bypass this limitation

1395
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,560
because like the pool itself like this

1396
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,480
particular gs uh

1397
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,240
controlled by the protocol uh will

1398
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,640
actually definitely have more than 200

1399
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,119
dots

1400
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,880
to nominate so no matter how much how

1401
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,319
how small amount you have you can still

1402
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,000
deposit into this pool

1403
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,319
and the pool by itself can nominate um

1404
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,359
the total amount of install to all the

1405
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,319
validators so yes

1406
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,160
we can definitely bypass that and then

1407
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,079
the other thing is um

1408
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,760
people who are staking through polka dot

1409
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,880
js or

1410
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,160
um any of the other kind of more native

1411
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,119
staking like not

1412
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,480
uh exchanges and centralized stuff with

1413
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,200
polka dot js right now

1414
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,359
you stake ksm and you have to do this

1415
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,119
seven day unbonding period

1416
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,520
and then with polka dot it's even longer

1417
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,040
it's 28 days so it just takes forever to

1418
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,680
unlock

1419
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,560
with uh with karua and with akala you

1420
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,800
can

1421
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,960
in talking maybe you can show this but

1422
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,000
um basically you can un-stake

1423
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,079
early for a small fee

1424
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,440
um and that fee is shown i think as

1425
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,079
you're kind of um

1426
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,680
not checking out but as you're kind of

1427
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,079
going through this process

1428
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,480
yeah so fee so in this case you're

1429
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,079
you're basically unstaking instantly

1430
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,839
right and then you're paying a fee of

1431
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,319
.02 dot

1432
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,000
yes so the design of the liquid sticking

1433
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,760
pool is that if i go to the advanced

1434
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
tab you will see that we always have

1435
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,319
some maintenance some free

1436
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,599
dots or some free kusama available for

1437
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,680
redeem immediately

1438
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,720
so let's say that if an user we really

1439
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,319
want to redeem

1440
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,240
um the l dot back to dots immediately

1441
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,599
you can do so because there's always

1442
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,319
a portion to set aside um for free um to

1443
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,760
redeem

1444
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,680
but if you want to redeem immediately

1445
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,240
you need to pay a fee to cover the

1446
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,520
otherwise lost return of those free

1447
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,359
portion of the

1448
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,640
um and also like this is not option this

1449
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,280
is not compulsory so if you want to

1450
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,119
redeem

1451
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,400
there's actually three way for you to

1452
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,200
redeem you can say that i want to redeem

1453
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,800
now then i will

1454
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,480
i will have to pay some fee all you say

1455
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,119
that i was gonna redeem

1456
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,800
the typical way um that's like waiting

1457
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,200
for the standard unbounding period

1458
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,720
you can free to do so or you can also

1459
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,280
redeem to say that i want to redeem and

1460
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,480
there's

1461
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,319
a queue of unbounding um dots on the

1462
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,680
on the on the on the on the staking pool

1463
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,079
because like will be always

1464
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,760
rebalanced between the stick dots and

1465
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,960
the an unstacked dot so you can choose

1466
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,720
that which may be like

1467
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,400
five player later you need the dots that

1468
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,480
will be at that particular price

1469
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,839
so it's actually a lot of like advanced

1470
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
feature hidden in here that you can

1471
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,559
redeem

1472
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,400
in multiple way um you can redeem at no

1473
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,839
cost or you can redeem immediately

1474
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,800
so in that in the middle one that you

1475
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,440
just showed um

1476
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,240
basically the main difference would be

1477
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,119
every

1478
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,760
every day closer to the current date

1479
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,599
you're just

1480
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,440
paying a little bit higher of a fee is

1481
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,280
that right yes yes

1482
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,720
so thinking about that you want to um

1483
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
with your money from a fixed term

1484
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,680
deposit account

1485
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,040
right so you have to pay some fee or you

1486
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,040
have to lose some interest if you want

1487
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,119
to withdraw money from a fixed um

1488
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,079
from a fixed um deposit account and how

1489
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,160
much you want to

1490
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,839
how urgently you need the money um

1491
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,760
depend and you will forfeit

1492
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,000
how much interest you will be giving

1493
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,000
back

1494
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,160
awesome so i think that's um the the

1495
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,680
show off

1496
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,480
of the uh of the liquid staking protocol

1497
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,680
and um all these three particles like

1498
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,800
they work with each other

1499
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,280
um the liquid staking dots on the lksm

1500
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,079
can be used um to borrow um can be used

1501
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,280
as character

1502
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,680
can betray in the decks as well um and

1503
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,960
because we call ourselves like as a as a

1504
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,079
specialized network

1505
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,240
i would like to really show off

1506
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,079
something that's like why we call

1507
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,760
ourselves as a specialized network is

1508
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,800
because like we can

1509
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,720
customize stuff that's outside um the

1510
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,480
um outside application layer we can

1511
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,000
customize a logic has

1512
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,760
in the blockchain layer that can create

1513
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
something that's like amazing

1514
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,760
to boost the user experience much much

1515
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,119
friendlier so what i'm going to do here

1516
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,079
is i'm going to switch to a brand new

1517
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,480
account right

1518
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,240
i have this brand new account and i have

1519
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:27,040
nothing else but 500

1520
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,040
usd or kusd in this case i have no other

1521
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,839
assets

1522
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,000
we have this like pay as a goal or like

1523
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,480
fix the fee or bring your own gas

1524
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,760
i can start to trade immediately as i as

1525
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,920
long as i have some assets

1526
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,440
in the guru network so i'm going to send

1527
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,280
a hundred dollars to

1528
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,400
an another address i will just press

1529
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,480
confirm i'm going to type in my password

1530
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,079
and i can send it and the network is

1531
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,359
happily taking

1532
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,359
a fetch uh uh the iusd that i sent it

1533
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,000
was it will charge

1534
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,960
like a half of a dollar of the usd as

1535
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,160
the network fee

1536
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,800
so this is already a huge um user

1537
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,040
experience

1538
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,240
boost compared to other blockchains this

1539
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,200
is like making the

1540
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,520
transaction in akala or in kura much

1541
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,920
much

1542
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,640
friendlier and another very common

1543
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,960
scenario

1544
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,000
um that you experience is that uh if you

1545
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,960
arrive on

1546
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,720
kuru or you arrive on kala kala you have

1547
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,599
only dots right you have nothing else

1548
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,839
but dogs

1549
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,040
um and in this particular cases you

1550
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,160
still want to transact

1551
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,200
within uh we sing within kurura you can

1552
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,440
do so so

1553
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,680
i'm gonna borrow against my 1.5

1554
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,200
kusama let's pretend it in these cases

1555
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,680
i'm going to borrow against that

1556
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,960
i have no other assets i have only dots

1557
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,640
i can still change that

1558
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,599
i can change that and the network is

1559
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,160
happy to take a friction off my god

1560
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,200
or my kusama as the network fee to allow

1561
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,280
me to transact

1562
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,720
so this is like what we call uh bring

1563
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,960
your own gas flexi

1564
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,240
flexi fee and this is like you are not

1565
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,160
forced you are not

1566
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,319
uh you are not forced to buy some native

1567
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,400
tokens just to in order to

1568
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,480
to pay for the guest fee we think a

1569
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,480
specialized financial network

1570
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,599
should be as smooth as possible should

1571
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,760
be encouraging

1572
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,200
um the user to trader to trade other

1573
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
than tight you should really get some

1574
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,319
token before you can trade

1575
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,720
uh so this is the one the special

1576
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,319
functionality um that you can see that

1577
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,160
the power um

1578
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,680
if you can customize the network into

1579
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,119
the core level

1580
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,480
yeah um this person jack asked a really

1581
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,720
good question

1582
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,760
um and it's it's exactly right so he's

1583
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,440
so um

1584
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,839
is there any question regarding like how

1585
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,040
we um how we show this um

1586
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:44,319
this fixed flexible fee payment on gas

1587
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,319
yeah can you can you hear me

1588

okay well i'm glad it wasn't just me

1608
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,319
um so let's see what was i gonna say oh

1609
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:50,319
yeah there was a question about

1610
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,760
um from

1611
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:57,280
from who was it jack oh about how the

1612
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,000
pay your own gas or what's it

1613
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,119
basically the gas fee um bring your own

1614
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,200
gas so

1615
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,839
as i try to invite roytel back

1616
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,280
uh basically you were is it is he right

1617
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,640
there you hear me now

1618
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,000
yeah i can hear you right now i think

1619
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,119
it's awesome like we're building we're

1620
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,440
building web

1621
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,559
we're building web 3.0 but now the web

1622
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,920
2.0

1623
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,160
streaming service failed on us okay

1624
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,119
i was i was trying to answer the

1625
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,359
question so

1626
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,319
jack you are exactly right the way that

1627
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,280
the gas fee

1628
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,760
actually works um on the surface on the

1629
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,520
ui

1630
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,520
to the user it looks like you're paying

1631
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,319
in bitcoin or

1632
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,160
link or eth or whatever it might be but

1633
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,839
on the back end you're exactly right

1634
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,079
it's actually being sent to the akala

1635
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,160
dex on the back end and transferred for

1636
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,960
the aca which is actually the fee that

1637
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,760
has to be paid for that transaction

1638
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,760
so you were right there

1639
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,839
so yeah ruta do you have anything else

1640
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,599
in terms of demo

1641
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:02,240
we've got 51 questions

1642
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,920
yeah i would just maybe um in my screen

1643
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,160
show off um

1644
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,599
what one additional reason that you i

1645
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,240
mean all the kusama holders should

1646
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,280
support

1647
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,960
kura it's like when we launched guru

1648
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,640
um dan already hinted there's going to

1649
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,920
be a liquidity mining um

1650
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,599
reward incentive program so

1651
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,599
it'll be super awesome like if you

1652
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,440
launch if kura launched

1653
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,720
you can not only you can start to trade

1654
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,040
your kusama token

1655
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,319
you can also earn some return by

1656
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,480
providing liquidity

1657
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,920
by maintaining stablecoin there's a lot

1658
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,760
of fun stuff you can do

1659
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,160
by participating in this network as an

1660
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,160
early computer so i think this is

1661
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,920
a really amazing chance to push straight

1662
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,640
no better way to push up kusama with a

1663
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,760
set of

1664
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,200
useful consumer um protocol along with a

1665
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,760
way to participate the network and get

1666
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,359
return

1667
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,319
get rewards yeah i know we actually had

1668
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,599
a question about

1669
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:57,920
that six percent someone kept

1670
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:01,520
someone asking a few times um is

1671
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,240
so i guess um bit i need to find

1672
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,599
bayes bayes was asking and i just like

1673
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,880
there's so many questions

1674
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,440
uh well hey

1675
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,319
i guess baze will find that question and

1676
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,720
come back to it

1677
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,920
someone also asked about the crowd loan

1678
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,520
and

1679
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,480
how they lock and contribute to all that

1680
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,000
let's keep the conversation um kind of

1681
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,119
focused more on the product today

1682
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,880
there's going to be

1683
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,480
we've done crowd loan presentations in

1684
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,280
the past and we're going to be doing

1685
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,799
at least one probably more before that

1686
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,079
starts

1687
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:39,839
so trust us we're going to be giving you

1688
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,520
probably more education than you even

1689
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,920
need on how that whole process works and

1690
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,640
we'll

1691
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,760
we'll be doing that um when the time

1692
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,280
comes we're

1693
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,440
we're waiting just like you guys and we

1694
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,760
don't know dates or anything like that

1695
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,200
but it's it's going to be soon it's it's

1696
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,119
looking like

1697
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,760
um the question about the liquidity was

1698
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,160
six percent of kr will be allocated to

1699
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,200
early

1700
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,720
liquidity providers how many early

1701
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,599
providers will that

1702
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,960
apply to and is there like a fixed

1703
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,839
amount or how does that

1704
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,799
work no because like this is a brand new

1705
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,200
area right so

1706
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,640
um we think six percent is going to be

1707
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,200
distributed across

1708
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,079
the very first 12 months is upon network

1709
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,839
genesis

1710
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,280
and that's the total the minimum total

1711
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,559
that we the network is willing to

1712
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,880
incentivize um

1713
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,079
early adopters and because like this is

1714
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,799
a brand new area

1715
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,559
we will be reviewing um all the

1716
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,359
governance process of the network we're

1717
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,400
reviewing

1718
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:38,640
uh where incentive incentive is needed

1719
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,400
at most for example if more stable coin

1720
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,240
is needed um

1721
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,760
every two week the governance process

1722
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,960
will review there should be more

1723
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,440
incentive deploying

1724
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,040
into the stable stable coin meeting if

1725
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,319
more tax volume or the more tax

1726
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,920
liquidity is needed

1727
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,599
um every two weeks the government's

1728
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,079
process will say that okay there will be

1729
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,000
slightly more incentive in the in the in

1730
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,079
the decks at that particular pair

1731
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
so you'll be constantly updating but the

1732
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,799
goal for the network is to give out

1733
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,920
um six percent at minimum with for the

1734
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,599
various 12 months

1735
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,440
for everyone that contributing that's

1736
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,040
trading that's providing liquidity

1737
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,599
that's meaning stablecoin

1738
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,240
um or maintain the lksm token in the

1739
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,599
network

1740
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,280
so yeah there's so many ways to

1741
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,240
participate

1742
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,920
and that so i guess there's a little bit

1743
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,040
more to his question like

1744
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,720
or his or her i don't know um the first

1745
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,760
he's saying or he or she is saying like

1746
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,760
the first is it is it a cap on

1747
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,559
like time how do you how does the six

1748
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,040
percent get distributed across that

1749
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
12 months if there's all these different

1750
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,240
ways of

1751
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,880
allocating that yeah i think that's like

1752
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,799
the

1753
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,799
in the very early we because the network

1754
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,920
was freshly generous

1755
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,040
genocide so we don't know um and what it

1756
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,520
really depends on

1757
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,480
every constant review of every two weeks

1758
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,040
but um

1759
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,640
the goal is to to dispute this i think

1760
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,960
the very early there will be more

1761
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,160
uh incentive as well currency to end

1762
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,000
will be slightly less

1763
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,839
um because that by then the level should

1764
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,400
be already bootstrapped so

1765
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,680
i think the best way um to get more the

1766
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,440
maximum amount of reward that you're

1767
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,040
able to get is to get in early

1768
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,200
and constantly checking the governance

1769
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,400
process of like where the most incentive

1770
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,000
will be located there

1771
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,520
and supply um to those um protocols

1772
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,880
cool okay well we're hitting an hour

1773
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,240
so for those of you who need to go um

1774
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,000
feel free we're finished with the

1775
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,760
presentation um

1776
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,040
we've got a lot of questions so i think

1777
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,960
we can spend

1778
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,119
maybe 10 minutes working through these

1779
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,559
as quickly as we can

1780
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,480
and what what we can do and

1781
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,040
this is going to take some work but i

1782
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,079
think we can we can commit to this is

1783
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,839
we'll go through the questions

1784
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,640
afterwards that we didn't answer and if

1785
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,520
there's any

1786
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,200
questions that are like particularly

1787
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,559
good questions we'll get some q

1788
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,880
a written up and send that as a

1789
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,960
follow-up to everybody who is on this

1790
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,720
on this call so apologies if we can't

1791
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,799
get to your question but we'll

1792
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,599
answer as many as we can now and then

1793
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:06,640
respond with the others

1794
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:10,160
so the first

1795
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:13,760
question is um

1796
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,319
the most upvoted so they're asking

1797
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,079
um i i think one of the most asked

1798
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,960
questions is unanswered

1799
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,040
was yesterday's build a call email

1800
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,200

1801
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,119
well there's um how do i say that

1802
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:30,240
there's a

1803
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,040
community reward event so if you do have

1804
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,000
a code

1805
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,400
and if you do check the website's

1806
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,040
official

icloud.network then it is the official

1808
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,960
channel and if you received any emails

1809

akala foundation just make sure you're

1811
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,280
checking the domain

1812
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,160
if it's at akala.network then that's

1813
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,119
coming from

1814
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,119
the akala foundation

1815
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:59,280
second question is um

1816
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,440
okay is there a date for kurora's

1817
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,480
auction process i already answered that

1818
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:09,440
no soon

1819
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:11,599
um okay let's see

1820
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,200
they're asking if the if u.s citizens

1821
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,559
will be eligible for

1822
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,000
the crowd loans and parachain auctions

1823
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:23,200
um we are working with regulators

1824
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,599
and legals and i don't have a

1825
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,440
definitive answer at this stage it's

1826
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,799
likely

1827
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,559
maybe but we will know that um

1828
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,799
it's not a no but it's also not a yes

1829
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:39,520
but we'll know that once um the auction

1830
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,520
process opens cool

1831
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,839
okay

1832
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,480
this okay this question i answered about

1833
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,480
l dot and dot

1834
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,559
the kind of receipt and how your l dot

1835
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,839
balance is going to be constantly going

1836
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,520
up in relation to reflect what your dot

1837
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:59,359
balance is doing behind the scenes with

1838
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,240
the staking

1839
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,240
that's a good question

1840
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,680
um so in the intensity stable coin dusty

1841
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,359
swings

1842
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,520
will be made

1843
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,520
so

1844
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,839
so the next question i see is um

1845
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,079
carrera is intended to be the defy hub

1846
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:25,359
of kusama and akala

1847
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,520
will be the defy hub of polka dot um

1848
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,359
will this be the only defy hubs or will

1849
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,559
there also be other

1850
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:36,079
d5 platforms well we see

1851
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,799
the um the poke gonna have like a 100

1852
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,520
power chance

1853
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:41,440
so there's going to be always open and

1854
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,960
trustless way for people to build right

1855
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,880
but what i can say is that currently

1856
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,160
karura is going to be the product and we

1857
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,640
want the permanent project

1858
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,760
in in kusama we had a very well the top

1859
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,160
developed project

1860
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,520
um in terms of like project completeness

1861
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,200
so we have the code set

1862
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,720
uh the whole code ready to go being

1863
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,440
audited three times

1864
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,440
um so i mean as things evolve there will

1865
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,039
be more specialized network but i think

1866
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,079
at this stage we will say that we

1867
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,640
are the most ready the top pronoun

1868
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,520
project

1869
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,960
to go in this in this direction and

1870
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,559
obviously the question regarding like

1871
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,880
what the the kusama

1872
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,799
the crew are serving kusama and the

1873
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,000
akala serving polka dots

1874
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,520
the the idea behind is that guru is

1875
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,119
always going to serve the kusama

1876
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,839
community and the kusama community's

1877
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,000
culture

1878
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:27,119
is very different from the polkadot

1879
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,440
community sculpture

1880
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,880
so i'm always using this example that

1881
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,920
for kusama it's like

1882
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,200
wilder it's like i don't want to say dgm

1883
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,920
but it's more of like

1884
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,799
risk-taking aggressiveness um and

1885
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,599
vibrance

1886
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,160
um polkadot is more of like um serious

1887
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,680
um

1888
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,799
security uh bankrupt security or things

1889
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,880
like that so

1890
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:50,720
upon launch this two network is the same

1891
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,079
but they will evolve in their own very

1892
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,079
distinctive style i would say

1893
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,400
okay i'm gonna keep skip there's a lot

1894
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,640
of build-a-collar questions we've

1895
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,880
already answered that

1896
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,880
um

1897
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,000
so this so why i have a kala in kura i

1898
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,160
already answered that

1899
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,839
too it's basically to serve the d5

1900
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,119
demand of of the kusama and polka dot

1901
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,799
yeah and then i think there's a lot of

1902
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,720
questions in the chat regarding that can

1903
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,200
a u.s citizen participate in the crowd

1904
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,720
on

1905
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,119
i i mentioned earlier that i didn't say

1906
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,119
no

1907
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,520
but i mean we are working with with

1908
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,520
legals and regulators

1909
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,839
i don't have a definitive answer today

1910
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,440
but we'll find out right

1911
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:39,839
yep um

1912
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,640
how many they're asking how many kar

1913
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:43,520
they could

1914
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,839
potentially receive as part of the crowd

1915
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,799
loan for kusama

1916
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,319
um yeah i think i'm very already shared

1917
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,720
the numbers right so for the

1918
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:54,000
one year lease the minimum amount of kr

1919
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,799
that you are receiving

1920
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,559
per kusama contributed is 12. you might

1921
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,559
get more but that's the minimum amount

1922
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,039
it's guaranteed

1923
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,480
and with with that being said we know

1924
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,839
that polka dot

1925
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,440
has the maximum lease pair chain slot

1926
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,520
lease of two years

1927
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,920
we don't actually know yet the kusama

1928
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,119
team hasn't revealed the the maximum

1929
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,359
so when rurita is saying one to 12

1930
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,720
plus this is for assuming we have a one

1931
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,319
year slot

1932
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,920
there's a chance that it could be less

1933
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,440
than that or more than that we this is

1934
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,240
one of the key things we're waiting on

1935
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,520
from

1936
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:31,599
gavin and the team at kusama yeah that's

1937
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,920
the culture of kusama like expect health

1938
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:37,920
you don't know until it's live

1939
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,920
like a day before yeah

1940
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,680
um exchanges

1941
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,520
let's we'll skip that and you'll just

1942
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,799
find out later

1943
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,799
um okay um

1944
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,119
they're asking this is a good question

1945
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:56,720
and kind of more recent so

1946
01:04:53,119 --> 01:05:00,480
why did akala decide to re-denominate to

1947
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:02,640
1 billion and kr at 100 million

1948
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,599
well i think it's mostly due to the

1949
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,280
reason that

1950
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:10,079
polkadot itself has a redenomination

1951
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,039
it will give out a much nicer ratio like

1952
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,079
for example if you

1953
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,720
um take kusama you get some kr token you

1954
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,960
will see

1955
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,720
you will see the similar nice ratio when

1956
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,880
you stick dot to get some

1957
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,000
aca token as well it's purely for that

1958
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,440
reason um

1959
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,280
yep um hope to answer that

1960
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,280
yeah and the other aspect of it is the

1961
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,200
the underlying like

1962
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,119
the decimal point problem there was

1963
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,799
quite a bit of issues with

1964
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,200
um i think polkadot in the beginning

1965
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,280
keeping the original token supply

1966
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,680
added a lot of complexity with like too

1967
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,440
long of decimal places

1968
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,720
so that was the other that was the other

1969
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,520
reason for

1970
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,520
the akala one

1971
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,839
i call

1972
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,280
okay um

1973
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,480
let's see take a couple more

1974
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,880
oh someone's asking about the

1975
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,559
collectibles tab

1976
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,920
uh nfts and maybe i can just add to this

1977
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,200
like what is zakala's

1978
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,400
kind of i guess thoughts around or

1979
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,079
strategy around nfts

1980
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,359
i think there's already you can see

1981
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,839
there's a collectible tab there's

1982
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,920
already

1983
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,880
some collectible being given in the test

1984
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,480
nets um

1985
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,839
because we've been building this test

1986
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,440
net for a long time so i think that

1987
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,240
hasn't been up and running for over half

1988
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,400
a year

1989
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,440
it's a way to reward the early uh

1990
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,599
participants

1991
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,280
in the test net there's already some

1992
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,039
entity being minted in the testnet and i

1993
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,240
think they would also be carrier

1994
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,440
uh to mainnet as well um and

1995
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,000
then maybe you can share a little bit

1996
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,039
like um about the collectible that maybe

1997
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,799
we have some

1998
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,640
surprise when we're going to go launch

1999
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,920
on the on the crowd on stage i'm not

2000
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,480
sure how much you want to share but

2001
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,000
maybe

2002
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,280
take the stage dan um

2003
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
yeah i don't think there's too much to

2004
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,520
share on that like quite yet so we

2005
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,440
we're just thinking around other ways to

2006
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,559
kind of think and incentivize

2007
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,319
um people who are early contributors and

2008
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,240
crowd loan supporters so

2009
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,839
um there could be some kind of surprises

2010
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,480
that pop up in that

2011
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,960
collectibles tab come come time for the

2012
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,319
crowd loans yeah i would just say that

2013
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,119
we think uh we are we are making history

2014
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,680
right so i mean

2015
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,760
if you guys uh put supporting along with

2016
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,079
this right uh maybe there's a piece of

2017
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,039
um

2018
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,839
unique collectible that may be earned

2019
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,839
through this process

2020
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,640
here's a question that i saw pop up a

2021
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,799
few times today

2022
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,319
um who is this that's a good question

2023
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,559
brian

2024
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,000
so as traffic picks up within the

2025
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:45,039
network how does this affect

2026
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,920
gas and this is a question that

2027
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,720
relates to kusama and polka dot um so

2028
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,640
maybe you can

2029
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,720
answer that one yeah okay awesome

2030
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,480
question i think the um

2031
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,160
my point of view on gas fee is that we

2032
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,520
want to keep the gas as low

2033
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,839
as possible it's um the gas fee is not a

2034
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,839
way um to boost the network values

2035
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,880
in fact the gas fee should be kept as

2036
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,319
low to

2037
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,920
as possible to encourage transaction

2038
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,440
activity happen on the network and

2039
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,039
there's that those are the stuff that

2040
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,159
bring the network values

2041
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,719
um in our rough test as a project and i

2042
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:19,520
think we

2043
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,239
see tps scale at a thousand or above

2044
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,440
that

2045
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:24,719
so um the way that we calculate gas is

2046
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,640
weight based rather than the

2047
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,319
the mechanism you most of people

2048
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,880
familiar with the ethereum which is like

2049
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,920
building

2050
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,560
for the photogas fee because

2051
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,319
the power chain has much higher capacity

2052
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,520
in processing transactions

2053
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,719
we think um we're able to maintain a

2054
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,560
very low gas fee

2055
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,239
um for for for as extend extend

2056
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,000
i would say for the for the near short

2057
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,600
term to medium term futures um i don't

2058
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,880
think that's going to be a problem

2059
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,239
and if we are hitting even hitting that

2060
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,480
bottleneck of like two thousand

2061
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:58,400
or a thousand transaction per second uh

2062
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,960
the ultimate solution um

2063
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,640
it's just like in the imagination um

2064
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,640
stage at this stage is always

2065
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,480
what scavenges polkadot within pogba

2066
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,960
does there's a little bit long term but

2067
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,799
i don't

2068
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,640
want to get kept to carry too much on

2069
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,279
that i would say there's always scalable

2070
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,880
solution

2071
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,880
when building a polka dot and we always

2072
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,880
have a way to maintain low gas fee

2073
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,080
yeah i want to pulse i showed something

2074
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,359
last time that

2075
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:25,279
that people i think liked and i'll just

2076
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,960
share just to add on to what you're

2077
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:32,239
saying about polka dot within polka dot

2078
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:35,839
um if i can find it real quick oh yeah

2079
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,839
here it is

2080
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,040
so it's it's

2081
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,279
definitely something that's in the

2082
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,799
future but it's it's pretty interesting

2083
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,080
to

2084
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:49,679
to kind of think about so i'll just

2085
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,319
share this real quick

2086
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,560
and i will i will say that this is this

2087
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,560
is nothing official

2088
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,880
this is a this is something that i built

2089
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,199
myself when i heard about polka dot 2.0

2090
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,320
and what it could potentially be

2091
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:07,679
and what he what retal is referring to

2092
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,520
is like relay chains within relay chains

2093
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,679
so what you could have is a kala

2094
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,679
starting as a para chain here

2095
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,080
but then this eventually deciding to

2096
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,840
branch out and build our own relay chain

2097
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,000
which then connects into the original

2098
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,960
polka dot so you've got polka dot within

2099
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,840
polka dot within

2100
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,719
polka dot in this diagram and this is

2101
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,560
potentially

2102
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,159
where we could be heading in the future

2103
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,840
kind of fun to think about

2104
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:31,840
we'll see if it comes true

2105
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,560
um okay it's let's take like one more

2106
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,560
question

2107
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,880
carrera tokenomics i pasted the link in

2108
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,800
the chat

2109
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,239
so akala dot network slash karua slash

2110
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,520
token

2111
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:53,520
is a good place to go for that

2112
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,679
and yeah let's let's call it a day we've

2113
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,880
been here for an hour and 15. like i

2114
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,199
said i'll go through the questions and

2115
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,760
anything that we didn't answer i'll

2116
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:07,040
try to create a response if it's if it's

2117
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,600
a good question

2118
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,360
and that's that's about it hopefully you

2119
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,199
guys learned something new about

2120
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,520
i i know i i learned something new and

2121
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:17,360
had fun looking at the product demos

2122
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,560
this will be this is being recorded and

2123
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,000
this is going to be live

2124
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,679
on our youtube so definitely um

2125
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,600
watch out for our twitter we'll post the

2126
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,280
link on our twitter and then feel free

2127
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,040
to share it with your friends if you

2128
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,560
learned something and want to kind of

2129
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,159
help spread the word so

2130
