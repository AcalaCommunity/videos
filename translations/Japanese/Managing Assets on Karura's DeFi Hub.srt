最初にお見せするのは、

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,200
まずは

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,920
ウォレットページです。

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,719
ここではKaruraプロジェクト内の

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
すべての資産を

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,359
管理することができます。

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
ご覧のようにKARトークン、

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
KSMトークン、

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,600
aUSDトークンを持っており、

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
you can freely transfer um to other

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
voltages

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
by just interacting with this front-end

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,359
dap you can manage your assets as

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,440
if like one of the aggregation of your

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,000
assets um get access to

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,480
value transfer or get access to things

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,760
like

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,480
minting btc mint in poca btc

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
or do inter production transfer for

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,879
example if i want to transfer

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
um alcohol asset from my collar to for

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,879
example hydradex

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
i can select here and do a interchange

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,039
transfer so this is

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,320
almost looks like an uh a user very

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
friendly wallet they can

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
you can access like um in my opinion way

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,559
better than than just um

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,559
than just using polkadot.js to to to

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
interact with the the blockchain

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,560
what you're showing here is a wallet

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
that can be used similar to people have

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
on polka dot js now or even some of

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
their mobile wallets but

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
when they connect what they would do to

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
actually see these numbers here is it

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
correct that they would go up to the

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
polka dot

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
js extension and connect their polka dot

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
js account to this wallet and it would

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
show

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
their live balances within this wallet

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
is that

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
yes yes yes definitely and the poke.js

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
is very similar to the

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
metamask equivalent on polka dots um you

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
can manage multiple accounts

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
in this wallet section as well so i can

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,920
change to another demo account here

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
you can see all the stuff i refresh on

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
the fly i can change back to my original

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,960
demo account

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
and you can also see a history of your

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
past transaction

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
so very very user-friendly very very

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,240
consumer-focused

58
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
this is your your one-stop to access

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
your your assets

60
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,719
on cora yeah so you basically connect

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
one

62
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,479
account from your polka dot js and then

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
it shows you every wallet that's kind of

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
connected to that

65
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,119
account yes yes

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
and obviously in in pogo.js you have the

67
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
right um you're the way to manage like i

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,879
would like to use this on alkala

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
i only wanted to use this um this

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,959
particular watch address

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
maybe only on relay chain on kusama all

72
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
you can say that i would like to use

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
this

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
wallet in all the available power chains

75
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
and relations

76
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,000
so you can get it's the your the user's

77
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,400
um

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
um ability to choose like where this

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
wallet is going to be made available and

80
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
if you make it available

81
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,360
for garura it will appear here and you

82
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,160
can manage that so when the caller

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
is launched um it's going to only say

84
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
akala and have the akal logo when

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
carrera launches it'll have the kura

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
logo in the upper left

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
and then this is always going to say

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
this for the test net so akala mandala

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
is the test net

90
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
so yeah that will be that will be only

91
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
the the name of the

92
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,640
the network when they're live yeah and i

93
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
also want to give a little bit hint here

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,519
so

95
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
kura is the sister network of akala

96
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,400
right so when they

97
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
when they're born they are almost

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
identical but when they go

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,959
live and when the genesis happens um the

100
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,480
two networks might take different paths

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
like you might see assets that will be

102
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
only available

103
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
on guru ra because like they will be

104
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,040
only available on kusama or you might

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
see feature they'll be only available on

106
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
karua

107
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
because like it's the wild cousin of

108
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
polka dots and you will see the similar

109
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
stuff happened on kura as the main

110
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
alcohol is the main as well so when they

111
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
generalize this

112
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,239
it's the same but they might evolve into

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:40,720
its own distinctive

114
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,720
set of features
