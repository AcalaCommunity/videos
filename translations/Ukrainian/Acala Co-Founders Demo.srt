1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
awesome uh yeah so uh good morning

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,319
everyone uh this is betty uh co-founder

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,480
of akala

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,760
and we also have brian a co-founder and

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
cto of uh

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,759
akala here today with us um and

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,359
he's actually prepared a full rail cross

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
uh d5 demo for you

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
so i'll just be very shocked and very

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
brief on my introduction

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
um i guess before diving in um because a

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,560
color has been around for a while last

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
year we run

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
again the same poker d5 demo we've

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,440
already run

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
a full suite of d5 applications

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
and then it's great to see this year

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
everyone you know has got their

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,680
application up and running and it seems

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,000
you know we're very close to

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,520
where the vision is going to be and it's

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it's worth sharing you know what we

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
think

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
the future might look like um i think

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
we've got you know bitcoin

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
uh which is the calculator error that's

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
one thing and then ethereum

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
is perhaps the mainframe uh error of

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
blockchain

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,559
and now i think we are entering the

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,440
so-called cloud computing

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,239
um where everything as a service um

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,479
that's where

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
we're heading i think um so we kind of

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,439
believe that you know future will be

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,000
multi-chain and then a specialization

37
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
uh it's gonna trump uh generalization so

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
you're gonna

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
your chain is gonna specialize in a

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
specific domain and do

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,439
uh certain things really well and solve

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
some problems very well

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
um and also change shouldn't be rigid it

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
should be upgradable

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
so that's that's what we think it's

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
going to happen and also

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
where we put our words out and build our

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,520
application

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,159
so this is the akala stack if you

50
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,600
uh haven't seen this one yet so a color

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
is still you know a full-fledged

52
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
blockchain

53
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
but it's ledger and trust is provided by

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
polka dot so this is what uh

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
you know i uh originally you know term

56
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,320
as

57
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
uh network security or trust as a

58
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
service

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
um and also in the middle of it as

60
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
oakare's default offerings

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,040
uh they're offered you know a service

62
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
like customizable modules right

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
um so for example you know we've got

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
this multicollato

65
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
uh stablecoin uh backed by dot liquid

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
dot and then you will also see you know

67
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
bitcoin like poker btc

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,959
can be used as collateral as well um and

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
then we

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
our liquidation is automatic and use a

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
hybrid of

72
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,239
emm decks um and auctions

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
um and um and then another thing that i

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
think brian will actually demo you today

75
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,520
is liquid staking so this is a

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,040
a tokenized uh staked dot uh or l dot

77
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
uh so it's a bit like die and see that

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,920
right allows you to earn staking

79
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,760
rewards while youth farming in d5

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,080
chestlessly

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
and you can also say you know evm is a

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
module on on our you know

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
service modules so we're fully evm

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
compatible

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,120
you can build smart contracts or any

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
type of dap on top of a color

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,000
so basically you know akala offers d5

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,080
as a service and then

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
yeah so and as we're demoing today is

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
probably the beginning of

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
you will see composable services so that

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,440
means

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,400
depths are composable with each other

94
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,519
that's a given

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,800
um but also smart contracts and depths

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,800
from other blockchains will be

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
composable uh with akala

98
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
and anyone you know who's be able to do

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
crushing

100
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,640
transactions together um so hopefully

101
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
you uh you'll get a taste of it today

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
and uh that's my introduction i'll hand

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,560
over to brian

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,560
now yeah sexpedit um so let me share my

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
screen

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
cool so you should be able to see my

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,680
screen now um yeah so

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,159
this is our um test net this is not

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,760
the mandana test that we're running on

110
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
yes so this is what especially make

111
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
the powertrain test next so it's

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
currently uh connecting to our version

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
of rococo so you can see

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,080
um we have some power change connecting

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,000
to it and

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
just um yeah so um so we can show some

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
questions

118
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
demoing so let's get started um so first

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
thing

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,760
you probably want to do is what you want

121
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,079
you should have already some

122
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
ss there will be dots or bitcoin uh or

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
maybe ethereum

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,440
so for in this case then you if you have

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
already a bitcoin you can use uh program

126
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
vdc

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
to um are using bitcoin to mean coca btc

128
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,600
and then using

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
question transfer to transfer program dc

130
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
into

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,040
a color so obviously some question

132
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
transfer fee will be applied

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
and then once you've got some program

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
pdc

135
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
there's a few things you can do with it

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
so one thing of course you can do is

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
sell it but this

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
well probably not the best idea so

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
actually it does make some money without

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
selling them

141
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,960
so that's where the stable coin protocol

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,880
comes handy

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,360
so we can start a new along

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,759
so using the btc as the devoted

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,840
so let's say i can deposit my 0.2

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,880
program dc i will be able to borrow

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,919
up to in this case 7000

148
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,240
so i can borrow all of it

149
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
and then you will see my liquidation

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
price is

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,560
this number and my current ratio is 120

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,759
so this is um slightly on a dangerous

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
size so

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
maybe it's a good idea to borrow

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
slightly less so i can pretty

156
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,479
comfortable

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
um it's unlikely bitcoin price will drop

158
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,120
to 30 000

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,680
hopefully um yeah so this the

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,039
next second just review there will be

161
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,520
some interest rate charge on the

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
borrowed

163
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:53,199
amount that's my probatory issue

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:56,720
so this i can make a transition

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,919
yeah so this will um make three thousand

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,919
uh sorry five thousand akala usd

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,000
uh from the poker pc i have deposited

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
so now i have some money what can i do

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
with it

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:15,120
uh we have the swap so there's a dex

171
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,639
which you can use to use the usd to buy

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
other assets so you'll be able to buy

173
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,199
also question access as well um

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,639
including project pdc and

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,479
dot cell run btc and few other assets in

176
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,479
the future

177
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,120
so in this case maybe i want to buy some

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,759
dots which is obviously a good

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,240
idea so i can spend

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,560
1000 asd which will buy this amount of

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
dots

182
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,880
so once that's confirmed when you have

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
thoughts

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
if you're not going to use it

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
immediately it's probably a good idea to

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,000
stake them so you're earning the staking

187
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,360
rewards

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,120
which is have a reasonably good return

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
so you can go to a poker network to do

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
the staking or

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
another way is using a liquid stating

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,960
protocol to do a sticking which is

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,720
much more easier so this is the express

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,400
ui so you just enter the amount of dots

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,160
you would like to stake and

196
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,360
click save button and that's

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,039
all you need to do to stake dot and

198
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,000
the protocol are decentralized and

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,120
protocol will handle all the data

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,639
selections domination nominations etc

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,720
but of course you can also vote for your

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
favorite validators if you want to with

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
your l dots

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,599
so now i've changed all my dots to

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,599
eldors and

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
then you will be able to later and

207
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,919
better vote for the metadata if you want

208
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
to

209
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,199
um we are still uh working on the ui for

210
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,039
this

211
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,479
area so this is the advanced screen

212
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,680
so um you can see the uh history

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,560
um you can if you want to redeem you can

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,400
you can so you can uh just wait for the

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
whole unbounding period which will be

216
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
um seven days okay summer 28 days on

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,319
pokeball

218
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
and then just wait and which we won't

219
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
charge

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,400
you an extra redeeming fee but if you

221
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,120
really need the money right now

222
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,720
and up to the certain amounts then you

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,240
will be able to redeem them

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
immediately but we'll be charging you

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
some

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
of the redeeming fee because uh you're

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,200
skipping the unbounded period

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
but if you really need money uh need the

229
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
dots right now this will be

230
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,399
handy so now you have the outdoors and

231
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
the

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,200
you the staking rewards

233
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,560
and how could you and like boots like

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,200
increase the um

235
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
the rates from the thoughts so another

236
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
way to do that

237
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,880
is good for example you can do is

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,880
add liquidity to our decks so that is

239
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,360
basically lost certain amount of

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,760
asd and lot your assets

241
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
and then you will be supplying the

242
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
liquidity to our decks

243
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,399
and which will um

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
if people when people make trades you'll

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,279
earn additional

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
fees as rewards we also have the

247
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
liquidity

248
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,080
incentive program so you also at the

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
same time

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,320
in addition to the fees you any

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,760
additional usd

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
um as rewards as well

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,560
so this is adding the liquidity to

254
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,640
the decks and once and

255
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,360
then at later stage if you want to you

256
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,800
can also redeem the liquidity

257
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
reading a token back later

258
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
yes so the next thing i want to show you

259
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
just a

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
little quick this is still again working

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
progress and we're still finalizing all

262
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,640
the details and

263
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,399
finalizing the ui but we have the

264
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
governance feature so it will be

265
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,440
somewhat similar to pogba

266
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
and kusama but will be slightly more

267
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
complicated

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
we have the hometown council which will

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,120
be one the one main engine for the

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
stable point protocol

271
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,760
for the hallmark also so i managed for

272
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,720
the

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
liquid staking vertical so as the elder

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
holders

275
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
you'll be able to participate the

276
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,560
homework council

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,640
by using your elder to vote for um

278
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,800
as the sa holder account holder you will

279
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
be person able to participate the

280
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,040
general counsel and the hong kong

281
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
council governors

282
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
so yes so those are still working for

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
ways so it's

284
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
not empty but hopefully a later stage

285
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,519
will have much more thing

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
in our test net to shoot

287
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,240
so now um you have already um

288
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
having the thoughts making your profiles

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,160
while you sleep

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,480
what can you do with um what else can i

291
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
do

292
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,600
so another thing you can do is um you as

293
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
i

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,720
show you i generally a bunch of aoc from

295
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,200
my poker pdc and then next thing if i

296
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
want to be

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
increase my profit by taking some more

298
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,880
risks i can transfer my

299
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,240
akala usd to the laminar network

300
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,279
so let's just transfer to some account

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,440
so let's say how to transfer 2000 a

302
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,720
little bit

303
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,040
so let's do a question transfer

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,040
from akala to the laminar so you can see

305
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
the method is x token transfer to

306
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
protein

307
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,279
so this will transfer the money to the

308
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,440
laminar technique

309
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,720
so this will be making a question

310
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
transfer and this

311
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
will take a slightly bit more time so

312
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,320
while this is

313
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
transferring i'm going to quickly show

314
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
you uh

315
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
on the laminar side so assuming the

316
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
transfer already

317
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,360
says that i already got some asd and

318
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,240
then i will be able to

319
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
like do a swipe so this will um the

320
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
laminar will

321
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
allow you to do trading with sensitive

322
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
assets so

323
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,240
there will be like for example foreign

324
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
exchange or like others like gold and

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,360
oil etc

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,480
so let's say i want to buy some euro

327
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
maybe because

328
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
well i'm going to travel to europe

329
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,839
sometime

330
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
europe sometimes so maybe i'll have some

331
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,279
euro

332
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,839
so so i can swipe

333
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,959
some aosd to the laminar euro

334
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,200
and i also i also can do some margin

335
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,000
trading so i can for example

336
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,440
i leveraged trade bitcoin or level trade

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,639
ethereum or just do

338
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,040
some my forex trading

339
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:52,079
so i can deposit the money into the

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,680
the margin pool um

341
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,480
and then i can just say i can choose up

342
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,240
to 20

343
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
times leverage in this case so

344
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,839
to to do a margin trading

345
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,120
yeah so let's open the position i'll

346
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,839
start getting the 20 plus exposure on

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,639
the usbjp trading video

348
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
this so with the question transfer

349
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
should already success so

350
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,880
um let's check the events so you can see

351
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,519
um yep so we have the question token

352
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
transferred

353
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,440
here so you can see this is sending

354
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
uh uh for example relay message so from

355
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
a paragraph to passion

356
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,279
uh message uh relates through the uh

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,399
religion which is the roku

358
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,000
of home fork of the roku in this case so

359
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,079
on the laminar side you can see

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,680
uh we have a deposit event

361
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,480
should be this one so uh so 2000 aod is

362
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,279
deposited into this account

363
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,639
so this is basically um so the industry

364
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,600
is basically

365
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,720
the equestrian aoc transfer between

366
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,079
color and the lamina

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,880
yeah so um that's all of the

368
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,079
demo i'm going to show you so um just

369
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,079
last but not least

370
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,160
um we are also working on

371
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,600
the xcm functional token implementation

372
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,880
so this will allow everything including

373
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,920
other powertrains to

374
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
more easily just compose compostable

375
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
with each other

376
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
so i've like well we have created open

377
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
runner module library and created some

378
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,639
of the question

379
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
token transfer asset which is kind of

380
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
used by quite a few

381
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
project things including platinum phalla

382
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,760
and

383
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,920
a few others and so to implement the

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,120
question transfer so i'm also creating

385
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,240
some implementation guides and

386
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,040
some implementation plans um to in the

387
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
future to

388
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,279
further help everyone um to implement

389
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,360
the question

390
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
asset transfer so this will allow

391
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
everyone

392
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
to be able to compose with each other

393
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,040
more easily

394
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:20,720
just by integrating our library

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,720
so that's all i have for you today
