00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,120
hey everybody this is brett a developer

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,080
at akala

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
and in this video i'm going to be

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,600
talking about how addresses work on

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,639
polkadot and kusama

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
so if you're coming from the world of

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
ethereum you might be used to addresses

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
looking something like this

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,040
but in the world of poken kusama you

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,240
might be used to something like this

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
a bunch of different addresses with a

12
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,320
bunch of different formats all from one

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
account

14
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
so how does that work well let's start

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
with an analogy

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
here we have a bird and in english we

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,359
can write the word bird like this

18
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,720
in chinese we might write it like this

19
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,599
and in spanish we might write it like

20
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,199
this

21
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
a bunch of different ways to write the

22
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
same exact thing and they all represent

23
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
the same thing

24
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,559
well your addresses in polkadot and

25
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,000
kusama kind of work the same exact way

26
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,520
your wallet will hold your public and

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,040
private key and all the different

28
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
formats you see depending on the chains

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,879
you attach to are all just different

30
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,440
representations of that same public key

31
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,960
for example here we have this public key

32
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,559
and on polka dot it would be represented

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
like this with a format starting with a

34
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,120
one

35
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
kusama would be represented like this a

36
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,199
format starting with a capital letter

37
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
and in the substrate generic address it

38
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,440
would be something like this

39
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
starting with the number five so that's

40
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
pretty cool that means that you can use

41
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,760
one address or one account across all

42
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
the different chains

43
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
and while that is true it's not

44
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
recommended

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,159
typically it's better to have distinct

46
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,119
accounts with their own private keys for

47
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
each network

48
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
the biggest reason is security if one of

49
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
your accounts becomes compromised

50
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,080
then the assets in your other accounts

51
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,000
are safe so let's see this in practice

52
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
here i'm on the polkadot.js website and

53
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,439
we're going to create two new accounts

54
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,600
really quickly so you see that i have a

55
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,200
distinct uh seed phrase right here i'm

56
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,560
going to click save

57
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
give it a name let's call it make this a

58
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
kusama account

59
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
and give it a password

60
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,880
and we're going to create one more

61
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,439
account for polka dot

62
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,720
again see it's another distinct seed

63
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,799
phrase different from the previous one

64
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,079
it's going gonna call it polka dot

65
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
i'm gonna give it a password

66
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
and now you'll see that i'm connected to

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,840
the polka dot network and when i

68
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
reload the page

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,840
both of the addresses pop up and again

70
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,120
this is not what we recommend doing

71
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,879
it's recommended you have a distinct

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
account with its own private key just

73
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
like these two

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,720
and that they're only set up for one

75
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
network each so we're going to change

76
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
this one

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
to only be viewed on kusama and this one

78
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,959
to only be viewed at polka dot

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
and now if i reload this page again

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
you'll notice that only the polka dot

81
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,319
extension account pops up

82
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
and on the kusama side

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
only the kusama network extension pops

84
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
up

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
okay that's it for this video i hope

86
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
everyone learned something and let us

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,000
know if there's any other videos you'd

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,000
like us to cover

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
thanks
