00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hi everyone, this is Bette. You are here,
congratulations! You are witnessing the 

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
launch of the decentralized web,
the first ever crowdsourced parachain 

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,080
auction on Kusama, Polkadot canary
network. 

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,120
Now of course Acala canary network,
Karura, is at the very forefront of this 

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,120
unprecedented launch.
By supporting Karura's crowdloan here 

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,560
you will be helping us
to launch the DeFi hub of Kusama, 

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,040
which will allow you to trade, stake, lend
and borrow 

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,520
and earn various youths on your digital
assets. 

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
But of course no promises, expect chaos
and expect 

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,280
Karura. Now let me run you through
number of ways to participate in the 

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,240
Karura crowdloan. 

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
If you have a referral link, you can use
that to join the event directly, 

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
otherwise you can just go to our website
acala.network to participate. 

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
There are three ways we recommend to
participate in the event 

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
to maximize your rewards, but it's
permissionless event 

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
so you can well make your own judgment
on how you would like to participate. 

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Well, obviously, you can participate just
directly on this website 

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,600
using polkadot.js extension or
you can participate via our partner 

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,120
exchanges
or via our partner mobile wallets. 

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,360
We will continue to add official
partners to the list 

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,320
as they become ready. Please, do reach out 

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
to the exchanges and
wallets for any support questions. 

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Before you start though, do check if you
have the extension 

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,320
installed and also have some free KSM
in your wallet to participate. 

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,520
The Karura crowdloan will airdrop a
minimum of 

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
12 KAR rewards for 1 KSM contributed in
the event. 

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,440
Okay, now let's connect to the extension. 

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Please read and accept the terms and
conditions regarding the event and also 

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,240
the privacy policy,
before you proceed. Your acceptance will 

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,120
be a
signed message from your current account. 

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,640
It won't be sent on chain
and won't cost you anything. 

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,960
If you have contributed to the event
already, you shall see a balance on top 

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,760
and estimated KAR rewards. Then just put
in the KSM 

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,640
contribution amount. Notice the lease
period 

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
is 48 weeks, so if Karura successfully
wins the auction, 

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,160
your KSM will be locked for 48 weeks 

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,640
and 30% of all rewards are transferable
up front, the remaining will be vested. 

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
You can contribute multiple times
during the entire crowdloan period. 

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,960
If you used a referral link, the referral
code will be filled in automatically. 

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Otherwise you can just grab a code from
our discord community 

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,600
and you'll receive 5% bonus.
Now you can just 

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,280
submit the contribution transaction to
the Kusama relaychain. 

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,600
This may take a few seconds as it will
wait for Kusama to finalize and confirm 

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,840
your
contribution transaction. 

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,240
And that's all done! Please do share
your great achievement on Social Media. 

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,720
In any case,
congratulations again and thank you for 

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,400
making history
with Karura!
