1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,879
so next thing i'm going to show you um

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,200
is how to deploy a uni swap to the akala

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880
blockchain

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
i would like to use the units of ripple

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,000
directly but unfortunately the uni swap

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,440
ripple is using the very old version of

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
easters

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,039
so there needs a lot of water to migrate

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,119
into the

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
newer version to be compatible with both

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,920
djs so i'm just

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,760
taking the artifacts from the unit slope

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
ripple

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,200
so those are the json file

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
um so actually let me just run it so

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
this will

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,280
deploy the unit contract to

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,360
our test net so

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,960
so this is the all the setup required um

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
so in the deploy um smart uh deploy.js

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
you can see

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
the code it's just a pretty standard eso

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
stress there's nothing special

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
to akala it's just a normal ethereal

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,240
project so you can see um

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,119
here i'm creating uh uh the yasay token

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,439
contracts for the

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,799
color and the top token this is the

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,799
country address

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
so this is a system contract so we can

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
pick the country address

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,880
so you can see this is a bunch of sales

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
to keep things simple

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,360
and we'll deploy the units of factory

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
contracts and we deploy the uni support

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,680
contracts

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,200
just put in the control address

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,200
approve um so we can

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,600
do some transfer add some liquidity

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,680
and just prints much more information up

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
so this is basically the scrap to deploy

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,479
units work

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,880
on our test net so you can see

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:55,840
it deploys the router to the suggest

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,840
so i'm going to change it address here

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
and run this square so this square will

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
basically

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
takes the units to broker again do some

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,079
proof

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
uh check some balance and do a unit

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,679
slope trade

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,280
that's in this case you try to sell some

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,959
of those to buy some sale token

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
um so it would try to sell exactly one

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,319
dot to buy

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,560
hong kong to buy a sound amount of sa

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,599
and this will print the balance to

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
verify if the trade is success

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,360
so it's running on this net so you can

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
see um the before

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,720
balance the trade after balance so the

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,879
dos amount reduced by one

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,920
the ac amount increased by roughly one

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,400
yep you can check the liquidity

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,400
pool in the trading period

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,319
you can see um this one charges some

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,440
amount of liquidity fee as well

68
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,280
so this is basically um how you can

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,599
like write a scrap to trade unit

70
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
with the scrap so obviously you can't

71
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,360
easily connect this to your existing

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,720
ui to get things working

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,319
um in the setup js we don't do too much

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,280
in special special things so

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
what we do especially basically create a

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
provider so this

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,000
case in this case this is uh ether's

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,440
provider so it's offered the implemented

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,280
by the body

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
implementing the provider interface

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
abstract provider interface of esos

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
so it's abstract provider so it works

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,360
with css

84
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,920
js and this takes a websocket provider

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,159
which is basically in a node url

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
wait for community create the

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,959
creator signing keep here so you will be

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
using the one coming from the

89
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,799
environment variable which i have

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
defined

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,599
myself or it just takes the test

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,280
keep here if you're running this on your

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
local test name

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,319
and create a signing key create a signer

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:14,000
and this is the again

96
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,720
abstract signus from the ethers

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
yes and that's pretty much it so now you

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
with this will

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,320
then you can just use it as a normal

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,000
um wallet

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
and this should just work with your

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,919
existing deployment scrapper and other

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
scrap they're using ethers js so this is

104
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
basically

105
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,199
um how you can deploy

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
the unit swap contracts into our test

107
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
net

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,400
and or if you want you can also deploy

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,400
this to your local network so

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
you just if you don't set up any

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
environment
